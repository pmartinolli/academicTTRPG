		"abstract": "From the very first days of digital gaming, sport-themed videogames have been a constant and ever-popular presence. However, compared with many other genres of games, sports-themed videogames have remained relatively underresearched. Using the case of “sports videogames,” this article advocates a critical and located approach to understanding videogames and gameplay. Unlike many existing theorizations of gameplay, such as the “magic circle,” which theorize play as a break from ordinary life, this article argues for a consideration of play as a continuation of “the control of the established order.” It argues that many videogames, and in particular sports videogames, can be understood as “themed” spaces which share similarities to other themed locations, such as fast-food restaurants and theme parks. These are “nonplaces” themed to provide a sense of individuality, control, and escape in a society that increasingly offers none.",

Safley, this Article examines how federal courts across the country are\napplying the Turner standard today in cases involving the First Amendment free speech\nrights of inmates. Are courts too quick today to support the censorial proclivities of\nprison officials? Do judges too readily capitulate in deference to the concerns of those\ntasked with overseeing the incarcerated? Those are the key questions this Article\naddresses by analyzing inmate access to magazines, movies, books, and other common\nforms of media artifacts. This Article's determinations stem from opinions rendered in\n2010 and 2011 at both the federal appellate and district court levels.",

		"abstract": "The shock and grief the Chaosium family felt at the news of the passing of our beloved and revered company founder,&nbsp;Greg Stafford, cannot be measured. Greg died yesterday in his sweat lodge at his home in Arcata, CA. Mercifully, his passing was painless and quick. He died as he lived, on a spiritual quest of enlightenment.As one of the greatest game designers of all time; winner of too many awards to count; and a friend, mentor, guide, and inspiration to generations of gamers, “the Grand Shaman of Gaming” influenced the universe of tabletop gaming beyond measure.Greg founded The Chaosium in 1975, and from the outset (to quote his own words) “was never content to imitate, but instead published games that were original in their style of play, content and design”. Under his leadership, the company quickly became renowned for its originality and creativity, and was responsible for introducing numerous things to the hobby that are standards today. As John Wick (7th Sea, Legend of the Five Rings) memorably said, “The older I get, the more I hear young RPG designers say ‘Never been done before!’ And then I just point at something Greg Stafford did a few decades ago.”Greg’s work in roleplaying games, board games, and fiction have been acclaimed as some of the most engaging and innovative of all time. There will doubtless be many valedictory messages over the coming days from the countless people that Greg inspired and enthused across his many interests and passions - Glorantha, Oaxaca, King Arthur, shamanism, mythology and more.For now, we leave you with the words of the Myth maker himself, speaking at the 2018 ENnies Awards ceremony, his last public engagement. Greg was immensely proud of the work Chaosium had done in recent years, particularly&nbsp;since his return as chair&nbsp;of the board in 2015. Ultimately, on reflection, he recognized that everyone’s success in the gaming industry was down to the enthusiasm and support of the fans. We at Chaosium recognize that countless RPG fans are fans (including us!) because of Greg Stafford and what he achieved.Our heartfelt condolences to Greg’s wife Suzanne, and his children Noah, Alisha, Jason, and their families.Vale Greg - the team at Chaosium#WeAreAllUsCondolence Thread on BRP CentralWe have created a&nbsp;special Condolence Thread at BRP Central - The Chaosium Forums for messages from the gaming community of condolence, and remembrance, and celebration, about Greg Stafford.If you would like to show your appreciation for his life and legacy, or express your feelings, or pay your respects, please feel free to leave a note there. Greg's wife Suzanne and his family know that he was greatly loved, respected and revered in the gaming community all over the world, and they have the link to this thread to read your posts when they are ready. Greg's family request that you respect their privacy in this time of grief.&nbsp;https://basicroleplaying.org/topic/8417-greg-stafford-condolence-thread",

		"abstract": "Background. Several authors from different fields have already mentioned the educational potential of role-playing games (RPG). As tabletop role-playing games (TRPG) present some similarities with small adult groups in learning and personal development situations, what about their transformative potential?\nAim. The purpose of this article is to describe the tabletop role-playing game’s emerging context, a few of its specificities and functions, to show links with several education, play and game, and personal development theories, and to raise awareness about its transformative potential.\nMethods. Three complementary approaches were used: a literature review (academics and role-players), action-researches through a transformative role-playing game (“TF-RPG” – a TRPG plus a debriefing), and data cross-analysis.\nResults. Participants are involved in the TF-RPG through four levels of reality, namely the character, player, person, and human being, which can be associated with four dimensions of learning: knowing, doing, being, and relating. The unveiling of links between the TF-RPG experience and their personal journey offers the participants various ways of learning and paths towards personal development.\nConclusion. TRPGs are particularly effective to foster knowledge acquisition, develop role-play skills, strengthen team building, encourage collaborative creativity, and explore one’s personal development.",

		"abstract": "Many of todays hottest selling games--both non-electronic and electronic--focus on such elements as shooting up as many bad guys as one can (Duke Nukem), beating the toughest level (Mortal Kombat), collecting all the cards (Pokmon), and scoring the most points (Tetris). Fantasy role-playing games (Dungeons & Dragons, Rolemaster, GURPS), while they may involve some of those aforementioned elements, rarely focus on them. Instead, playing a fantasy role-playing game is much like acting out a scene from a play, movie or book, only without a predefined script. Players take on such roles as wise wizards, noble knights, roguish sellswords, crafty hobbits, greedy dwarves, and anything else one can imagine and the referee allows. The players dont exactly compete; instead, they interact with each other and with the fantasy setting. The game is played orally with no game board, and although the referee usually has a Performance is a major part of role-playing, and role-playing games as a performing art is the subject of this book, which attempts to introduce an appreciation for the performance aesthetics of such games. The author provides the framework for a critical model useful in understanding the art--especially in terms of aesthetics--of role-playing games. The book also serves as a contribution to the beginnings of a body of criticism, theory, and aesthetics analysis of a mostly unrecognized and newly developing art form. There are four parts: the cultural structure, the extent to which the game relates to outside cultural elements; the formal structure, or the rules of the game; the social structure, which encompasses the degree and quality of social interaction among players; and theaesthetic structure, concerned with the emergence of role-playing as an art form.",

From a vast survey of primary sources ranging from eighteenth-century strategists to modern hobbyists, Playing at the World distills the story of how gamers first decided fictional battles with boards and dice, and how they moved from simulating wars to simulating people. The invention of role-playing games serves as a touchstone for exploring the ways that the literary concept of character, the lure of fantastic adventure and the principles of gaming combined into the signature cultural innovation of the late twentieth century.",

		"abstract": "During the 1980s, the newly established industry and youth subculture associated with role-playing games came under sustained attack from schools, churches, parents and governments, instigated by the Christian Right via organizations such as B.A.D.D. (Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons). While both the organization B.A.D.D and its claims linking Role-playing games to youth suicide, drug use and Satanism eventually were discredited, the impact of these accusations lingers on to the present. This article examines the impact of the role-playing game \"moral panic\" on the role-playing game community and investigates the responses and coping mechanisms utilised by those directly targeted and harassed by churches, the police, schools and governments during the height of the \"moral panic\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The article also investigates the effect that the shared experience of being targeted by a \"moral panic\" had on the formation of a role-playing counter culture and community.",

In the main experiment, 20 university students with experience in RP games and 25 nonplaying university students completed the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, a criminality questionnaire, and a demographic questionnaire. 23 university students rated the seriousness of the 20 items of criminal behavior on the criminality measure. An additional 45 students participated in an experiment measuring the test–retest reliability of the criminality measure. Regression analysis indicated that RP experience did not relate to self-reported criminality; however, psychoticism, which was higher in the nonplayers, did predict criminality.

		"abstract": "The Satanism scare was a significant moral panic in America in the 1980s and early 1990s. Scholars analyzed it from a social constructionist perspective, citing a number of factors and developments whose confluence contributed to this high-visibility moral panic. The authors examine those factors that were deemed of importance in the rise of the Satanism scare, to ascertain why the scare seems to have waned in recent years. Particular attention is given to developments within the justice system, the professions of psychology and psychiatry, and the waning of the Anti-Cult Movement to explain why the panic lost momentum. Other contributing factors are also discussed, including the weakening of Christian Fundamentalism as a force in society and the shift of attention of the mass media and the general public to other topics. Attention also is given to various behaviors among youth that have redefined and contributed to the maintenance of Satanism as a social phenomenon of note.",

Released in 1974 -- decades before the Internet and social media -- Dungeons & Dragons inspired one of the original nerd subcultures, and is still revered by millions around the world. Now the authoritative history of the game is revealed by an award-winning journalist and lifelong D&D player. David Ewalt recounts the development of Dungeons & Dragons from the game's roots on the battlefields of ancient Europe, through the hysteria that linked it to satanic rituals and teen suicides, to its apotheosis as father of the modern video-game industry. As he chronicles the game's surprising origins (a history largely unknown even to hardcore players) and examines D&D's impact, Ewalt interweaves subculture analysis with his own gaming experiences to shed light on America's most popular (and widely misunderstood) form of collaborative entertainment.",

		"abstract": "This paper explores science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education in the context of inequality of opportunity by examining educational systems through two lenses: curricular mode and system scale. Curricular mode classifies learning experiences as addressing knowing, acting, or being, while system scale captures how learning experiences are aggregated into credentials. The paper argues that the curricular mode of being can be better implemented and credentialed within educational institutions if students learn to develop a self-narrative through navigating a multiplicity of learning experiences. Since narrative is implicit rather than explicit in existing university structures, the paper develops a speculative model based on role-playing games that integrates narrative and allows new forms of personalized credentials. The goal of the paper is to initiate a conversation around alternative curricular structures that allow emergent self-narratives within disciplinary structures.",

		"abstract": "Since the mid-1970s role-playing games (RPGs) have become a significant part of the leisure repertoire of millions of Americans. These narrative games allow their players to create a sense of participation in items from the popular culture; this sense emulates the sense of communal re-creation, participation, and ownership created among performers of verbal art and their audiences in cultures with thriving primary oral traditions. Role-players achieve this sense of participation by recontextualizing popular genres and materials from movies, television, books, and comic books as games through a selective reading process and highly specialized rules. There are RPGs covering a wide variety of popular romantic source products and genres, and role-players have created a great many styles of play over the years, leading to a complex system of genres within the gaming community. Role-playing in action is a verbal, performative art, supported by several roles: the players (who create and enact characters within the game), the game master (who prepares and performs the worlds through which the characters journey), and the designer (who constructs the framework for game performance by creating rules and settings).\n\nSince the early 1990s, when women began to enter this historically male hobby in large numbers, role-players have become more self-conscious about the narrative nature of RPGs. In conjunction with this sense that RPGs are devices for storytelling, some gainers have developed the sense that their games can be powerful social instruments; this sense is perhaps buttressed by the marginal image gainers have in the eyes of many. Gainers are often perceived as nerds, psychologically unstable people, and even Satanists. Whatever socially transformative power RPGs might possess, however, tends to be subverted by their reliance on source products that reinforce the dominant cultural order, as well as by qualities of the games themselves. The most significant impact these games seem to currently have is in the development of shared authority, collaborative imagination, and cooperative action within individual gaming groups, and perhaps also within the gaming community as a whole.",

All Ss were measured for personality dimensions of psychoticism, extraversion, and neuroticism using the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ)-Revised; for beliefs in paranormal phenomena using the Belief in the Paranormal Scale; and for involvement in gaming and satanic practices using the Satanic and Fantasy Envelopment survey. Data revealed that fantasy gamers were different from satanic dabblers in major personality characteristics, paranormal beliefs, and interest in satanic practices. Satanic dabblers were significantly higher on psychoticism, introversion, and belief in the paranormal. Evidence is not consistent with the hypothesis that fantasy role-playing games are precursors to satanic practices. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",

		"abstract": "Notre intérêt de recherche porte sur la stigmatisation des sous-cultures par la société. Afin d'étudier le phénomène de l'étiquetage social, nous avons décidé d'étudier une sous-culture dépréciée: la sous-culture des rôlistes. En effet, nos recherches préliminaires nous ont amenée à constater que cette communauté est décriée de manière très virulente. Cependant, nous nous sommes posés la question à savoir pourquoi une telle opinion? Pourquoi ce passe-temps est-il dénigré? Ces jeunes sont-ils dangereux ou fous? Les jeux sont-ils vecteurs de pathologies? Pourquoi une telle mise à l'écart? Notre but, dans cette étude, est d'identifier la stigmatisation et l'étiquetage dont ils sont victime et d'en comprendre les mécanismes. Nous voulons savoir si les joueurs sont des jeunes comme les autres ou en dehors de la réalité, une sorte de jeunesse dégénérée en mal de socialisation. La mise en marge de cette sous-culture par la société est un phénomène complexe que nous analysons dans cette recherche. Afin de mieux comprendre ce que sont les jeux de rôle, nous effectuons un bref historique des courants littéraires qui ont façonné le jeu de rôle jusqu'à aujourd'hui dont, principalement, le courant de la Fantasy, puis nous expliquons ce qu'est ce jeu de rôle. Pour mener à bien notre recherche, nous nous appuyons sur une méthodologie qualitative. Nous effectuons, une observation participante auprès d'un groupe de joueurs parisiens afin de comprendre leur dynamique et celle des jeux. N'ayant jamais joué aux jeux, nous confrontons notre point de vue avant l'expérience et après, afin de saisir si les jeux sont effectivement répréhensibles. Puis, nous interrogeons des non-joueurs pour connaître leur opinion sur les jeux. Des entrevues avec les joueurs nous permettent enfin de confronter les opinions et de comprendre quelle est leur position vis à vis des accusations à leur encontre. Le cadre théorique de l'École de Chicago et de l'interactionnisme symbolique nous permet de développer les concepts de l'étiquetage et de la stigmatisation, notions sur lesquelles nous nous basons pour effectuer notre analyse. Nos principaux résultats sont que les joueurs, considérés comme « déracinés », sont des jeunes comme les autres, passionnés par un passe-temps surtout inconnu. L'opinion générale serait propagée par les médias, entraînant une panique morale. Nous observons ainsi deux attitudes des joueurs face à ceci: devenir une source d'information; ou bien, développer une stigmatisation auprès de leurs accusateurs. La stigmatisation et l'étiquetage sont donc les résultats d'une influence extérieure impalpable. Il nous est apparu que le stigmate apportant le stigmate, le cercle apparaît difficile à briser.",

In a typical setting, a party of skilled adventurers engages on a dungeon crawl aligned along a common goal to beat the competition and to find and uncover enormous riches that wait out there—sounds familiar, you mean, to your daily work in business or R&D? Well, I can tell you that the similarities do not end here, and there are many eternal business and management principles hidden in the daily life of an adventuring party!",

The book also offers a detailed participant-observer ethnography on role-playing games, featuring insightful interviews with 19 participants of table-top, live action and virtual games.",

		"abstract": "The open-ended, informal, and socially negotiated nature of role-playing games creates a distinct learning challenge for newcomers to the hobby. The explicit rules of the game provide only an incomplete framework for structuring the actions of players, and the expectations and mores of a given group will add other, unspoken rules that discourage or reward certain patterns of behavior. Through a combination of casual instruction, mimesis, and situated learning, new players become acculturated to the ways of both role-playing games in general and specific games in particular. Online resources can facilitate this process, by placing individuals in contact with a wider network of fellow hobbyists, but the limited channel of communication available online also restricts the social cues that could otherwise contribute to learning.",

		"abstract": "This essay examines the aesthetic construction of nostalgia in the cover art of the Advanced Adventures, a series of tabletop fantasy role-playing modules published by Expeditious Retreat Press between 2006 and 2011. The art of these modules reveals a genre and period-specific set of aesthetic codes with distinct subcultural rules of application. In order to construct a sense of nostalgia, the cover art highlights the representation of adventurers, monsters, and dungeon environments within a unique visual style reminiscent of the early Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) aesthetic from the late 1970s and the early 1980s. The Advanced Adventures use nostalgia ideologically as a form of homage to early D&D, to assert the values of old-school gaming, and to chart a new direction for classic fantasy role-playing that challenges the style of play espoused by the current fourth edition of D&D (4E) published by Wizards of the Coast.",

		"abstract": "The article deals with the relation of immersion and the didactical potential of roleplaying.\nIt fathoms the extent to which role-playing games without a didactical goal still have\ndidactical potential, as well as the extent to which this potential is being exploited. Along the lines of\nthe concept of surplus reality, I specifically look into the subject of the role-playing game’s alternative\nreality and demonstrate that the didactical potential of methodically applied role-playing can only\nunfold by means of the generation of an isomorphous model of a real subject matter. It can then be\nshown that recreational live role-playing indeed has an enormous didactical potential, just like the\nmethodically applied kind. This potential unfolds just like in methodically applied role-playing, as live\nrole-playing generates an isomorphous model of our reality.\nOn the basis of these explanations I conclude with the development of a process-oriented definition of\nimmersion, which allows for an intermediary perspective on the phenomenon of immersion, instead of a\npurely subjective one.",

		"abstract": "The thousands of games and game systems described in this volume show that role-playing games have gained considerable popularity since the first appearance of Dungeons and Dragons in 1974. Schick, a succesful game designer himself, succinctly defines these paper or \"table-top\" games as \"quantified interactive storytelling.\" The reference guide proper is preceded by two informative sections, \"What is a Role-Playing Game?\" and \"The History of Role-Playing Games.\" The game descriptions are divided into 22 genres (and subgenres), and include fantasy (by far the most numerous), science fiction, comic book superheroes, espionage, and westerns. Each section begins with a brief descriptive overview and Schick's list of recommended games for that genre. Entries are also interspersed with brief essays and comments from designers concerning their games and their ideas about role-playing games in general. The game descriptions are supplemented by a directory of game publishers, a list of award-winning games, definitions of terms, a timeline, and a title index. Although very well written and well organized, this work is not a needed addition for most academic libraries, being recommended only for strong popular culture or games and recreation collections.\n--R.

Elle s'est beaucoup développée en France depuis quelques années, mais des idées reçues à son propos ont toujours assombri son image. De tragiques incidents et la manière dont ils ont été décrits ont amplifié le phénomène et beaucoup se demandent à présent si le Jeu de Rôle n'est pas nuisible à la santé mentale de ceux qui le pratique.\nUne telle accusation n'a pu que stupéfier les joueurs pour lesquels une quelconque influence néfaste est inimaginable. Il leur paraît impensable que les problèmes évoqués soient dûs au Jeu de Rôle et que les gens puissent le croire. Il nous a donc semblé indispensable de réagir face aux interprétations insensées que beaucoup dégagent, le plus souvent à cause d'une mauvaise information.\nAprès une présentation des Jeux de Rôle, il sera nécessaire de s'intéresser aux reproches qu' on leur fait et aux réponses que l'on peut donner à toutes les accusations dont ils sont la cible. On pourra alors montrer l'intérêt et les bénéfices de la pratique de tels jeux.",

Nous proposons une autre lecture de ce phénomène en étudiant comment les usages de ces jeux émergent, et le sens qu’on peut leur donner. Ces pratiques ludiques s’accompagnent d’une transformation des rapports à soi et à l’autre, d’un rapport au corps ambivalent. Ils participent enfin d’un processus de socialisation qui dépasse le seul cadre ludique et témoignent des transformations de notre société.",

		"abstract": "Massive Multi-Player Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) and Multi-User Domain Games (MUDs) are the most popular genre of PC games. In recent years there is a growing interest whether this type of Internet use, represents an \"addiction\". We recruited 22 former players (14 players of Internet and 8 players of pen and paper Role Playing Games - RPGs; mean age 27 +/- 5years who had succeeded to cut back the game without external help. We tried to describe players' perceptions of their previous \"addiction\" and compare their views. The study data was collected through personal interviews. Semi-structured interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed and subjected to qualitative content analysis. Based on the results, the players' expressed various perceptions, which constituted five categories: games' particular characteristics, negative effects and positive effects on players' lives, possible causes for their behavior, and future intentions. Significant differences were noted in players' perceptions between the two groups. For Internet users content analysis revealed the same basic problems: irritability, social life neglect, and disruption of relationships, sleep deprivation, school or university failure, and loss of interest in other activities. Younger players reported even more problems. Overall, Internet players attributed their problems to an \"addictive dynamic\". None of these problems existed in players of pen and paper RPGs. Those players reported feelings of satisfaction, pleasure, improved social interactions and friendship connected to the game. Four players who were adolescents, all former Internet players, characterized their previous Internet use as an \"addiction\". They were seeing their problems as more serious and disruptive for their lives. In conclusion, the majority of internet players recognize the \"addictive dynamic\" of the game, but they do not necessarily consider themselves as \"addicted\". They characterize their Internet use and its consequences as a \"choice\"; time loss and difficulty breaking off from the game were the more serious problems faced mainly by Internet players. It should be noted, however, that in contrast to clearly \"addicted players\", the players of this study were all able to overcome their psychological and behavioral problems without any external help after successful cessation of the Internet use.",

The present study examines how psychiatrists’ perceive role-playing games and whether they play them. Psychiatrists at a tertiary care centre in Canada completed a questionnaire assessing history of playing role-playing games and whether they associate them with psychopathology. Forty-eight psychiatrists responded. Twenty-three percent have played a role-playing game over their lifetimes. Twenty-two percent believed there was an association between psychopathology and role-playing games. A majority of psychiatrists who responded do not associate role-playing games with psychopathology. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.",

In a composition classroom, students are striving to create arguments that are cogent, demonstrate their ability to analyze, and embed those arguments in interesting and relevant pieces of writing. Parallels exist between composition pedagogy and the techniques \"players\" and the leader in a Dungeons and Dragons-like game utilize to tell a story: collaboration, understanding audience, and maintaining continuity and coherence. Teachers in a composition classroom and Game Masters in a tabletop, pen and paper roleplaying game use similar techniques to achieve similar goals. I will expose these parallels with the aim to demonstrate what composition instructors can borrow from role playing manuals.",

		"abstract": "The life story of Gary Gygax, godfather of all fantasy adventure games, has been told only in bits and pieces. Michael Witwer has written a dynamic, dramatized biography of Gygax from his childhood in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin to his untimely death in 2008.\nGygax's magnum opus, Dungeons & Dragons, would explode in popularity throughout the 1970s and '80s and irreversibly alter the world of gaming. D&D is the best-known, best-selling role-playing game of all time, and it boasts an elite class of alumni--Stephen Colbert, Robin Williams, and Junot Diaz all have spoken openly about their experience with the game as teenagers, and some credit it as the workshop where their nascent imaginations were fostered.\nGygax's involvement in the industry lasted long after his dramatic and involuntary departure from D&D's parent company, TSR, and his footprint can be seen in the genre he is largely responsible for creating. But as Witwer shows, perhaps the most compelling facet of his life and work was his unwavering commitment to the power of creativity in the face of myriad sources of adversity, whether cultural, economic, or personal. Through his creation of the role-playing genre, Gygax gave two generations of gamers the tools to invent characters and entire worlds in their minds. Told in narrative-driven and dramatic fashion, Witwer has written an engaging chronicle of the life and legacy of this emperor of the imagination.",

		"abstract": "Accident in fiction is always inevitable. When a character in a novel suffers a car accident, for example, the accident is the effect of the author's intentions, and therefore it is not accidental. The accidents in the narrative always happen the same way, reading after rereading. Drawing from this observation, the question that Narrative at Risk attempts to answer is, in its simplest iteration: how can narrative accurately represent accident when its textual representation is not subject to the effects of accident? I ask this of a number of American cultural objects that were produced over the last fifty years, from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy to the present. Narrative at Risk interrogates representations of accident primarily in novels and films--but also in television, roleplaying games, comic strips, and videogames--in order to examine how contemporary American culture ascribes meaning to the accidental. I read a wide array of accidents--from mechanical failures to failed suicides, depictions of biological evolution to games of chance--as providing a broad but coherent understanding of how American society has conceived of accident in relation to individuals, communities, and the species as a whole. Narrative at Risk , in treating media such as film, television, and videogames alongside literature, broadens our understanding of how accident developed as a danger over the past fifty years, as well as how various media influenced and shaped one another through borrowed reading practices.\nIn the introduction, I focus on the crystallization of the mass media that brought traumatic events into American homes again and again, specifically, the moment of President John F. Kennedy's assassination and the epistemological and ontological crises this event and its media coverage initiated. The first chapter reads the role of this mediation and the crises of the 1960s as they jointly inform representations of accidental mechanical failure. Through readings of four texts, I theorize a politics of accident, taking as my initial subject what Ronald Reagan called his most formative moment: his role as a train accident victim in King's Row (1941), and his discussion of this role in his 1965 memoir Where's the Rest of Me ? I delineate how Reagan's obsession with narrating accident later shaped a politics of the accident in texts such as David Cronenberg's film Crash (1996), Don DeLillo's novel White Noise (1985), Colson Whitehead's novel The Intuitionist (1999), and Rockstar Game's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004).\nThe subsequent chapter shifts from the first's broad historical range to texts composed and published at the end of the Cold War: Paul Auster's novel Leviathan (1992); Jeffrey Eugenides's novel The Virgin Suicides (1993); and \"Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man\" (1996) an episode of the television show The X-Files (1993-2002). I read the failure of suicide attempts in these texts as accidents that express the limits of intentionality, which bring to the fore the nation's inability to conceive of a future beyond the ideological bounds of the conflict with the Soviet Union that provided meaning during the Cold War.\nThe third chapter recontextualizes the final years of the Cold War. Here I read Richard Kenney's poem, \"A Colloquy of Ancient Men\" from his collection, The Invention of the Zero (1993), alongside two novels: Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park (1990) and Richard Powers's The Gold Bug Variations (1991). Rather than depicting the futurelessness of the United States, these texts look to deep history on the scale of evolutionary time. They depict evolution as a series of random, accidental changes that take place in the history of a species' development; in doing so, they together trace the Cold War fear of thermonuclear annihilation shifting to an anxiety of genetic manipulation. The fourth chapter turns to the 1970s to investigate the early years of the culture wars. I begin by reading how chance disrupts the narrative of Kathy Acker's novel Blood and Guts in High School (1984), then consider the religious right's hyperbolic condemnation of chance in TSR's roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons (1974). I then scrutinize games of chance in three other texts: Michael Cimino's film The Deer Hunter (1978); Thomas Pynchon's novel Gravity's Rainbow (1973); and Sam Lipsyte's short story \"The Dungeon Master\" (2010). These three cases demonstrate how chance undermines the paranoid fantasy that there are external forces authoring the world. Finally, Narrative at Risk concludes with an exploration of accident in the present through a discussion of two television shows--Breaking Bad (2008-2013) and The Americans (2013- )--and Steve Erickson's 2012 novel These Dreams of You . Imagining accidents as the fault of the government, these texts collectively suggest American culture's continued reliance upon teleological thinking and conspiracy theory.

		"abstract": "The third book in a multivolume series dedicated to the critical study of the virtual worlds of video game narrative and story. Third Person examines vast narratives across diverse media ranging from comic books to television and video games to literature.\n\nElectronic games have established a huge international market, significantly outselling non-digital games; people spend more money on The Sims than on \"Monopoly\" or even on \"Magic: the Gathering.\" Yet it is widely believed that the market for electronic literature -- predicted by some to be the future of the written word -- languishes. Even bestselling author Stephen King achieved disappointing results with his online publication of \"Riding the Bullet\" and \"The Plant.\"\n\nIsn't it possible, though, that many hugely successful computer games -- those that depend on or at least utilize storytelling conventions of narrative, character, and theme -- can be seen as examples of electronic literature? And isn't it likely that the truly significant new forms of electronic literature will prove to be (like games) so deeply interactive and procedural that it would be impossible to present them as paper-like \"e-books\"? The editors of First Person have gathered a remarkably diverse group of new media theorists and practitioners to consider the relationship between \"story\" and \"game,\" as well as the new kinds of artistic creation (literary, performative, playful) that have become possible in the digital environment.\n\nThis landmark collection is organized as a series of discussions among creators and theorists; each section includes three presentations, with each presentation followed by two responses. Topics considered range from \"Cyberdrama\" to \"Ludology\" (the study of games), to \"The Pixel/The Line\" to \"Beyond Chat.\" The conversational structure inspired contributors to revise, update, and expand their presentations as they prepared them for the book, and the panel discussions have overflowed into a First Person web site (created in conjunction with the online journal Electronic Book Review).",

		"abstract": "The ever-expanding capacities of computing offer new narrative possibilities for virtual worlds. Yet vast narratives--featuring an ongoing and intricately developed storyline, many characters, and multiple settings--did not originate with, and are not limited to, Massively Multiplayer Online Games. Thomas Mann's Joseph and His Brothers, J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Marvel's Spiderman, and the complex stories of such television shows as Dr. Who, The Sopranos, and Lost all present vast fictional worlds. Third Person explores strategies of vast narrative across a variety of media, including video games, television, literature, comic books, tabletop games, and digital art. The contributors--media and television scholars, novelists, comic creators, game designers, and others--investigate such issues as continuity, canonicity, interactivity, fan fiction, technological innovation, and cross-media phenomena. Chapters examine a range of topics, including storytelling in a multiplayer environment; narrative techniques for a 3,000,000-page novel; continuity (or the impossibility of it) in Doctor Who; managing multiple intertwined narratives in superhero comics; the spatial experience of the Final Fantasy role-playing games; World of Warcraft adventure texts created by designers and fans; and the serial storytelling of The Wire. Taken together, the multidisciplinary conversations in Third Person, along with Harrigan and Wardrip-Fruin's earlier collections First Person and Second Person, offer essential insights into how fictions are constructed and maintained in very different forms of media at the beginning of the twenty-first century.",

		"abstract": "Games are increasingly being used as tools to broaden pedagogical options in schools and create interdisciplinary linkages. This article pays particular attention to role-playing games (RPGs), and the applications they have for arts education. RPGs can be used in art classrooms and in arts-based research and as an exciting and useful form of collaborative art-making, interpersonal discourse and reflection. This article is divided into sections describing the games and the manner in which it has been applied to arts education. Interspersed within the article are reflections from the author's experience in a game that examines the politics of oppression called the The Tribunal, which resulted in introspection on both personal and societal issues. The article concludes that RPGs can help make both personal and communal meaning of experiences and foster the development of empathy.",

		"abstract": "Jouer à l’école, est-ce bien raisonnable ? Bien souvent, le jeu se fait rare après l’école maternelle, pour ne surgir à nouveau que le dernier jour avant la sortie des classes... comme si ce n’était déjà plus l’école et que l’on pouvait donc s’amuser un peu. Et pourtant... De nombreux travaux de recherche éclairent la place spécifique et le rôle original du jeu dans le processus d’apprentissage. Des enseignants utilisent des jeux de plateaux ou des jeux de rôle, et sont sollicités pour recourir au jeu vidéo en classe : la pratique du jeu dans le cadre extrascolaire a contribué dans le même temps à poser à nouveau la question de l’utilisation au service de l’acquisition de connaissances et de compétences. La définition, la place et le rôle du jeu à l’école ont une histoire longue et contrastée. Des initiatives variées, individuelles ou institutionnelles, ont été prises dans différents systèmes éducatifs : « jouer » à l’école est possible. Les enseignants qui intègrent le jeu sous une forme ou une autre ne sont pas forcément joueurs eux-mêmes : c’est l’impact positif du jeu sur la motivation et sur les apprentissages qui les a générale- ment convaincus de tenter l’expérience. Jeux dramatiques et jeux de rôle favorisent en effet la motivation des élèves, servent de levier aux apprentissages et sont des outils précieux dans une approche de l’enseignement orientée vers le développement de compétences. La connaissance des processus cognitifs plaide pour l’utilisation de jeux en classe, re- posant ou non sur un support informatique. Loin de pouvoir se passer de l’enseignant, le jeu éducatif exige de ce dernier qu’il « joue son rôle », rôle en partie redéfini par la configuration du jeu. Qu’il participe ou non à sa conception, l’enseignant conserve une place déterminante car, dans une visée pédagogique en relation avec le curriculum, le jeu n’est pas une fin en soi. Il doit y avoir un avant-jeu et un après-jeu pour favoriser l’analyse réflexive et les « compétences méta ». Ce dossier propose d’explorer ce renouveau dans les relations entre jeu et école, à travers une revue de la littérature scientifique récente, en France et à l’étranger.",

The game has received negative coverage, especially during the game's early years in the early 1980s. Because the term D&D may be mistakenly used to refer to all types of role-playing games, some controversies regarding D&D actually pertain to role-playing games in general, or to the literary genre of fantasy.\nPart of the controversies concern the game and its alleged impact on those who play it, while others concern business issues at the game's original publisher, TSR. The game is now owned by Wizards of the Coast.",

		"abstract": "In this professional resource for both public and school librarians, Torres-Roman and Snow give a concise yet thorough look at tabletop role-playing games (RPGs) and their role in library collections and programming. Starting with a gentle introduction to old school tabletop RPGs by way of their history and a rundown of the most popular titles, the authors walk librarians through the complete process of adding these games to their collection, discussing the qualities one should look for when considering what games to select, the technical aspects of cataloging them, and cementing RPGs as a bona fide resource rather than a bait-and-switch diversion. Torres-Roman and Snow aren't afraid to give real, practical advice about dealing with problem patrons and the potentially emotionally charged environment of gaming. Appendices include a guide to current games, with an easy-to-understand ratings system that allows review of the game's key parameters at a glance, and a list of games tagged by genre. VERDICT Librarians who have been successfully integrating role-playing games into their programs for some time won't find much new here, but those who are just experimenting with the medium will see that as an invaluable guide, and even those seasoned pros could use it as a handy desk reference.",

In this paper, we address the following question: what are the consequences, in terms of performance over time, of the adoption of an open BM? We study the U.S. Role Playing Game industry in which the leader moved from a proprietary business model to an open one before coming back to a closer approach. Several lessons can be drawn from the case study concerning especially the dynamics of value capture and value generation mechanisms, the unpredictable effects of an open business model and the drawbacks and risks of such an initiative.",

Today role-playing games research is an established component of game studies.

		"abstract": "How have the ways we imagine and understand games changed since World War II? Play and games, although inextricably connected, have come to mean quite different things in the early twenty-first century popular culture, and I argue that this change is a cultural product of The Cold War. Today, games are described as products, systems, and even rituals. It is assumed that all games have rules, and these rules are shared through code, manuals, and sometimes oral tradition. Whereas games are systems, play is the embodied phenomenon associated with navigating such systems. Play relates specifically to bodies, and is often—though not necessarily always—connected to games. The nature of games and play is generally agreed upon in both popular discourse and by game studies scholarship. People play games, people play with each other, and the essence of play cannot be reduced to any one product, container, system of rules, or even social ritual. Rules may contort the dynamics of play, but they cannot define the essence of the phenomenon. Building on these distinctions, this dissertation claims, first, that our definitions of games and play are discursively contingent. Second, it develops this point by showing how in the latter half of the twentieth century, games began to be explicitly valorized over play. Games are typically seen as valuable, productive, and potentially transformative, while play is normally associated with leisurely, childish, and chaotic behavior. Third, alongside the valorization of games over play there has emerged a discourse that this dissertation terms the ludic imagination in which “truth” is conflated with quantitative and competitive logics. The ludic imagination contributes to other studies of the Cold War by focusing on the value placed on rationality as well as the affects of isolation and fear that characterize the era’s popular culture and military policy. I use correspondence, internal reports and memos from the RAND Corporation Archive and The MIT Center for International Studies, as well as hobby publications and trade publications from The Ray Browne Popular Culture Archive and the Dragon Magazine CD-ROM Archive in order to reveal a historical arc that connects military ideology around games and play to popular culture. This arc includes documentation from the RAND Corporation, correspondence within a grassroots network of gamers that included play-by-mail Diplomacy hobbyists, and the design notes of Dungeons & Dragons players. Through these primary sources, I show how networks of military elites at the RAND Corporation overlapped with networks of grassroots hobbyists and together imagined the intersection of games and play. This reading evaluates the limits of these terms by considering how racism, sexism, and homophobia collude with the quantitative and essentialist worldview of military logistics. Here I evaluate the indebtedness of the ludic imagination to a reductionist and pragmatist military ideology and consider what potentials exist to play with its future definition.",

Para alcançar tal objetivo foram realizadas pesquisas teóricas sobre design de jogos, educação e RPG - Role Playing Game. Esta pesquisa também apresenta um resumo da compilação teórica sobre emoções e entretenimento, originalmente realizada pelo pesquisador finlandês, da área de design de games, Aki Järvinen. Para a realização desta adaptação foi feita uma extensa análise do jogo comercial Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition, em busca de conhecimento sobre sua construção, seguido da análise de um método tradicional de ensino de inglês e a estrutura física da sala de aula. Uma vez concluída a adaptação do jogo, um questionário foi desenvolvido para medir qualitativamente o entretenimento e as emoções dos jogadores sentidas durante uma aula utilizando o jogo adaptado, sob a luz da teoria da experiência do jogador desenvolvida por Aki Järvinen. Finalmente, após um experimento aplicado em sala de aula com um grupo de alunos iniciando o curso de língua inglesa, os dados qualitativos coletados com o questionário foram analisados. O resultado indicou que os alunos se sentiram mais entretidos e mais motivados durante a aula de inglês, utilizando o método com o jogo adaptado, do que a aula utilizando o método tradicional de ensino de inglês.",

		"abstract": "CAR-PGa is the Committee for the Advancement of Role-Playing Games, an international network of researchers into all aspects of role-playing games (RPGs). In the 1980s, there was a major campaign attacking RPGs. Because of the inaction of the game publishers' organization at that time, CAR-PGa was formed to find out what the problem was. CAR-PGa members' research showed that the charges—the same ones that are repeated to this day—had absolutely no foundation in fact. Today, CAR-PGa's primary focus has shifted from game defense to a study of all aspects of RPGs: Material is collected by members and sent to the Chair, who catalogs it and publishes a notice of the new acquisitions in the Newsletter along with other game information. When an attack on RPGs resurfaces, CAR-PGa makes sure that its members know about it and they check the relevant research and records of historical attacks, investigate the specific circumstances of the renewed attack, and respond with the hard facts.\n\nMembership is dues-free, but work is expected from our members. This can include a number of things: writing a letter to the editor of the local newspaper or writing a peer-reviewed paper for a scholarly publication; keeping a watch on the mass media for any story that may affect gamers; collecting material from anti-gamer organizations; an appearance on local TV or radio; finding us a grant; recruiting more active members; etc. Beyond that, we only ask that members keep us informed of these things, sending us copies of material produced or found so we can make it available to the rest of the group, and keep us informed of any changes in the membership-form data.",

By developing 3 sample games based on Greek\nmythology, Arthurian legends, and a widespread folktale type, I explored the process of\ncreating games that fit the limits of secondary classrooms and can be used to address specific\neducational standards. The sample games were tested with groups of high school and college\nstudents, and the results of the testing sessions evaluated in a narrative case study format.\nFeedback from the testing sessions was incorporated in the template, the final product of the\nthesis project. By exploring tabletop role-playing as a form of emergent interactive\nstorytelling, a connection has been created between traditional storytelling and popular culture\nwith the hope of reaching out to new audiences and introducing a stronger interactive element\ninto storytelling in secondary education.",

		"abstract": "For over three decades, there has been much controversy surrounding the use of fantasy role-playing games. The media and other groups have linked the use of fantasy role-playing games to violence, suicide, murder, Satanic practices, and other detrimental outcomes. Video game fantasy role-playing games have also been blamed for causing players to become depressed, isolated and suicidal. Empirical research on the effects of fantasy role-playing games on players is inconclusive. Heavy use of these games has been linked to negative outcomes. There is little information regarding whether the negative outcomes found in some studies are based on the format of the game (pencil-and-paper versus video game) versus the content of these games. This study investigated whether there is a difference among self-reported feelings of loneliness and depressive symptomatology among young adult players of fantasy role-playing games based on their level of use (heavy versus light) and format preference. A 2 x 2 factorial design was employed to compare groups of players on measures of loneliness and depressive symptomatology. Based on a review of the research, it was hypothesized that players who report heavy use of the video game format would produce significantly higher scores on depression and loneliness measures than other groups. The results indicate that those participants expressing a preference for the video game format showed significantly higher scores on the depression measure than those who expressed a preference for the pencil-and-paper format, suggesting that depressive symptoms are more common among those who prefer video game to pencil-and-paper fantasy role-playing games. Those participants reporting heavy use of either format produced significantly higher scores on both the depression and loneliness measures than those reporting light use. The results of this study suggest that there could be some detrimental impact of excessive use of fantasy role-playing games on players' social relationships and mood but it is also possible that those who are depressed and isolated tend to engage in excessive game-playing. Some implications for treating isolated and depressed young adults who use games excessively are discussed.",

		"abstract": "Learning experiences are not typically used to describe formal learning activities, such as in classroom, transmissive methods. Centred in the student, this term describe that the learner is experiencing something that, hopefully, contributes to a change in thinking, understanding, or behaviour afterwards. For this to happen, learning experiences should be active, meaningful, with social meaning, integrative, and diversified. We consider active learning experiences when the student has the main learning role. They should provide knowledge and skills that directly contribute to the learner's ability to perform more effectively in the context of workplace learning. Sharing and cooperation is fundamental, allowing the learner to interact with other active learners. The inherent increase in complexity demands the integration of different dimensions of knowledge, better achieved through diversified strategies. In this context, teaching and learning is more than the mere acquisition of content. It represents a process of learning by thinking-do-thinking. The learning experiences should be adequate to motivate the students and provide the necessary challenges for learning to take place. In this context, the concept is understood as a reinforcement of the goal of an educational interaction over its location (school, classroom) or format (course, program). The diversity of ways in which students can learn from and interact with teachers, in addition to the level of independence they may have when learning, is considerable. In this paper, we propose to include not only traditional transmissive approaches and practical work assignments but also designing and playing games. The latter is regarded as an integral part of the students' knowledge building, with the objective of being instructional with the main focus on the cognitive side of instruction. This approach is part of a broader pedagogical experience of applying gamification to a higher education subject in the course of computer science. It uses several game design mechanisms, such as adaptive challenges, rewards, curiosity and chance to increase the time students spend working, experiencing and learning. In addition to the award system that is being used to grade students, the learning experiences are also designed using game design patterns. We focus mainly in the design, development and assessment of a tabletop Role-Playing Game, with the purpose of providing an environment for reflection and concept learning regarding data survivability. The learning experience is evaluated through a specific Student Observation Record, evaluating the interaction between students, the dynamic of the learning experience and the overall learning degree.",

Research was centred around the question: to what extent has the non-institutionalized use of Role-Playing Games affected students' academic engagement and self-efficacy? This research was undertaken in order to investigate potential uses of the Role-Playing Game as an instructional tool. Mixed-methods research was employed, involving surveys regarding the amount of games played, student interviews, and teacher interviews. It was found that RPG use and self-efficacy were significantly positively correlated, RPG use and academic engagement were weakly to moderately negatively correlated, and that RPG use did not significantly impact the desire to learn. Recurring responses to interviews cited interactivity and ownership of narrative as factors contributing to RPG use by students.",

Der Leitfaden richtet sich an Sozialarbeiter, Pädagogen und weitere interessierte Personen aus dem Feld der Kinder- und Jugendarbeit, die nicht nur die Grundzüge des Rollenspiels nachlesen möchten. Der methodische Teil ist mit Beispielen direkt aus der Praxis durchsetzt und bietet somit die Möglichkeit das Konzept mit geringen Vorbereitungen selbst anzuwenden.",

		"abstract": "This  work  seeks  to  present  an  analysis  of  role-playing  games  (RPGs)  from  the perspective  of  their  richness  as  didactical-pedagogical  tools.  As  such, we  endeavor to  investigate  the  ongoing  research  regarding  these  games,  as  it  is  carried  out  in Brazil,  in  order  to  achieve  a  better  understanding  of  the methodology  that  has  been applied  to  the  study  of  this  brand-new  subject  of  science. Since  we  notice  a  trend  towards  marginalization  of  role-playing  games  – an outlook  that  could  curtail  initiatives  regarding  the application  of  RPGs  to  the  teaching-learning  process – we  consider  it  necessary  to  demystify  them;  therefore, pieces  of news  disclosed  by  the  media,  implying  a  connection  between  RPGs,  crime  and magic  rituals,  are  analysed;  materials  issued  by  religious  institutions  in  which  that connection  is  punctuated  are  scrutinized  as  well.  To  grasp  this  uneasy  relationship between  role-playing  games  and  religion,  we  refer  to  Max  Weber’s  concept  of disenchantment of the world, and  by  doing  so  we  infer  the  association  of  RPGs  to scientific  thinking – an  enlightening  conclusion  that  has  enabled  us  to  understand  the conflict  between  scientific  and  religious  thinking. Besides  discussing  these  preliminary  issues,  we  identify  in  role-playing  games some  features  from  Michael  Löwy  and  Robert Sayre’s Romantic Anti-Capitalism, a perspective  that  allowed  us  to  understand  certain  traits  of  these  games,  traits  that enable  an  educative  experience  in  contradiction  with  the semi-formation  offered  by Cultural  Industry,  by  proposing  an  action  grounded  in  the  partakers’  Experience (Erfahrung), instead  of  the  typical  commodities  of  the Cultural  Industry  that  are  based in  the  viewers’  Lived Experience  (Erlebnis).  We  also  deal  with  one  of  the  subject’s  particulars  we consider  most  significant: that  role-players  might  cast  a  non-deterministic  look  upon  the  history,  because  the tale  presents  itself  open  to transformation,  and  it  is  a collective  achievement  that denaturalizes  the  social  sphere.  Finally,  we  advocate  the  possibility  of  imbuing  role-players with  a  specific habitus , one  that  spurs  them  to  actively  acquire  reading  practice  and  cultural  capital",

		"abstract": "The role-playing game attracts a growing number of practisers. The aim of this master ́s thesis is to examine role-playing literature as phenomenon in libraries through librarians ́ attitudes. The paper is based on qualitative interviews with eight librarians: one personal interview with two librarians and six e-mail interviews with six librarians at different libraries. The paper starts with a definition of the term ”role-playing game”, its different categories and genres and a description of its background. We also discuss the debate about role-playing games and their position in society.\nWe use Pierre Bourdieu ́s theories about habitus, capital and taste and apply them to the librarians’ attitude towards users \nand literature. We place role-playing literature at the same level as popular literature. We describe the history of popular \nliterature and the criticism against it and focus on fantasy literature. The scientific aspect of popular literature, in which we place role-play literature as well, has become more acceptable during the latest decades. The result of this paper shows that the librarians have a positive attitude towards role-playing literature at libraries and they feel that it can stimulate \ncreativity and traditional reading as well as own writing.\n It can also attract people who don’t visit libraries regularly. The future of role-playing literature depends on the librarians’ \nwillingness to familiarize themselves with the benefits and drawbacks of role-playing games and also how they market \nthe games to their colleagues and the market of users.",

Evangelical gamers, have to negotiate criticisms and carve out a social space for themselves among their fellow-believers as Christians who play RPGs. The chapter explores both the strategies used to maintain them and the potential dissonances and ambivalences that they engender. It is divided into two main sections. In the first, the author presents a brief overview of the evangelical critique of role-playing games (RPGs) that emerged in the late 1970s/early 1980s. Secondly, following on from this, he draws on a range of primary materials and interviews with gamers themselves to examine the ways in which evangelical Christian gamers attempt to both respond to these critiques and create a specifically Christian space within the role-playing community.",

		"abstract": "The main purpose of this study is to make some notes as means of theoretical discussion for educators and researchers about the use of RPG in education. The first part of the theoretical reference of this work presents the history of roleplaying games (RPG) in the U.S. and Brazil and some studies on RPG in the U.S. and Europe. Based on these studies, IT provides a definition of RPG and its five types: table-top RPG, Larp, solo adventure, electronic solo RPG and MMORPG. In the second part of the theoretical reference, the arguments are about the concepts of Vygotsky and his theories in Brazil, some concepts of the Vygotskyan theory, their contributions to education and a reading of the RPG from Vygotsky. The methodology is the concept of state of the art and a possible reading of this concept from Vygotsky for the basis of the procedures of bibliographic survey and analysis of material collected. This was divided into three categories: educational material, books, theses and dissertations. Only those dissertations and theses were selected that have Vygotsky in its theoretical reference. The analyses address the production on RPG in Brazil and the difficulty of access to such production. The aim was to map the concepts of education that permeate the work on RPG in Brazil, in addition to relating some of them to the technicistic pedagogy. It also analyses the material on its use by educators as well as books, dissertations and theses on the assimilation of Vygotskyan theories. There is a need on the part of educators and researchers to take a critical position to address the RPG, and to have clarity in the design of man and society that permeates their practice. It was also discovered that the theories of Vygotsky are little known and exploited.",

We have also created new reader, author, translator, and editor's profile. We have tried to obtain the most accurate reader profile by analyzing the database stored in La Casa de las Conchas public library and by realizing a sample across Spain (Salamanca, Madrid and CNL of Valladolid). For the author, translator and editor profiles we have a small sample so we opted by personalized questionnaires send to the professionals in those fields. Also in this research we make an introduction to the role games: context, origin, history, arrival to Spain, types, characteristics of the players, advantages and disadvantages of theses games, social value of these games, particular editorial characteristics. Finally we analyzed the entries in the ISBN which gave us a total of 1170 titles. In this case we analyzed the editorial, game type, origin of the game, original language, price, and publication period.",

A brief analisys is made of the dissertation The Discourse of Scholarization of RPG and the relations between the author's appointments and the characteristics of the technicist pedagogy. Some practices of RPG in scholar space don't have an explicit theoretic reference, what allows the appearance of technicism in their discourse and end reproducing the already very criticized teaching system. Some theoretical reference in research about RPG and education go beyond this neopositivist vision of education. The necessity of reflection about the concepts related to education by researchers and professionals that use Roleplaying games is hightlighted.",

The authors, who codirect the Center, provide recommendations for supporting games as experiential learning tools both in and out of the classroom. Outside the classroom, the authors built a game collection, facilitated tabletop game nights, hosted a conference on games and learning, and worked to incorporate games as an experience for students to engage throughout their college career. The authors share both their successes and failures in launching a library-based Center for Games & Learning.

The purpose of this study was to explored the use of a tabletop role-playing game in middle school ELA classrooms to examine students’ (n=36) abilities to interact with and make meaning from a traditional classroom text (Richard Connell’s “The Most Dangerous Game”)., Background.Gaming continues to soar in popularity, both inside and outside of schools. As such, it is important to continue looking for pedagogically beneficial ways to incorporate gaming into classroom spaces, specifically English Language Arts and Literacy classrooms., Aim. In this article, we describe the game used for this study was modified from the Pathfinder system and designed to pair with Connell’s short story. We also discuss our qualitative approach to data analysis, and the three themes that emerged. First, students made gaming decisions based on their knowledge of the story. Second, students experienced the narrative through the lens of their characters. And third, students engaged in meaningful collaboration throughout gameplay., Conclusion. The findings support ongoing calls to look for pedagogically beneficial ways to incorporate gaming into ELA and Literacy classroom spaces.",

		"abstract": "Although the modern tabletop role playing game (RPG) movement began in 1974 when TSR published the first commercial RPG Dungeons and Dragons, it has been only less around ten years since RPGs have begun to be taken seriously by the academic community. Scholars and teachers alike are only now beginning to look at RPGs as instructional tools, works of art, and means of self-expression and representation. Lately, there has been a quest to discover how online games allow players to explore otherwise hidden parts of their persona, how shooting games integrate physics into their designs, and how RPGs can be considered as interactive narratives. According to Quijano (December 2007), when students play RPGs, they “take the role of characters in a story, and together with the teacher (or game master) they create a cooperative narrative while following a system of preset rules.” Currently, there are very few articles or books dealing with role playing games as narrative media, interactive simulations, or potential instructional resources. This paper will focus on role playing games as interactive narratives and as potential language classroom resources, and will specifically demonstrate that student exposure to RPGs results in the amelioration of the second and foreign language acquisition process.",

		"abstract": "Role playing games as we know them today evolved as a merging between war games, fantasy literature and, shortly thereafter, historical enactment. Historically, practices akin to role-playing and simulation is quite a bit older as tools for learning or social meaning making, but after the birth of Dungeons and Dragons the hobby community quickly took up this more serious mantle as well. Looking to a few unfortunate cases, and the obvious psychological power of role playing experience, many came to believe that role playing can have a profound psychological impact, but few evidence based studies have been published (for a review, see Lieberoth & Trier-Knudsen, 2015). Sometimes the therapeutic concept of “”Psychodrama”” is evoked as an earlier 20th century case (and suggested efficacy) of role playing as a positive tool for personal and psychological change, but digging a bit deeper, it turns out that early 20th century social psychologists conducted quite a few experiments of the effects of taking on alien roles and perspectives on attitudes and personality (Bowman & Lieberoth, in review). This presentation reviews what a hundred years of forgotten non-gaming psychology studies revealed about the effects of roleplaying – long before LARP and Dungeons and Dragons.",

The potential of digital games tocontribute in this way is being increasingly recognized, but the author argues that those interested inthe convergence of games, ethics, and education should more fully consider analog games (i.e., gameswithout a digital component). This argument draws from a qualitative study that focused on the use ofan analog roleplaying game in an undergraduate activity that explored ethical issues related to politics,society, and culture. The results of this study are examined through an educational technology lens,which suggests that games (like other educational resources) afford and constrain learning and teachingin certain ways. These results demonstrate that this game afforded and constrained ethics education inboth ways similar to digital games and ways unique to analog games. © 2016 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.",

It is a deep intellectual dive into the literature of SF/F's past that will fascinate any serious role-playing gamer or fan of classic science fiction and fantasy.  Author Jeffro Johnson, an expert role-playing gamer, accomplished Dungeon Master and three-time Hugo Award Finalist, critically reviews all 43 works and authors listed by Gygax in the famous appendix. In doing so, he draws a series of intelligent conclusions about the literary gap between past and present that are surprisingly relevant to current events, not only in the fantastic world of role-playing, but the real world in which the players live.",

		"abstract": "Whereas role-playing and table-top role-play games (RPGs) have been proven to have potential as therapeutic tools, playing RPGs is often stereotypically associated with social incompetence and psychiatric disorders. Knowledge regarding the stereotype and its implications is very scarce specifically among mental health practitioners. Therefore the present study aimed to narrow this gap in knowledge by examining the perception of Social Workers that are considered to be the forefront of mental health-care, in regard to the association between playing RPGs and mental health. A convenience sample of 130 Social Workers, recruited through social networks (e.g. Facebook, WhatsApp etc.), responded to an on-line survey dealing with their perception of their own knowledge on RPGs, the importance of such knowledge and the association between playing RPGs and mental illness. Results indicated an association between having higher knowledge of RPGs and lower perception of a link between playing RPGs and psychopathology. The study's findings emphasize the false stigma and its potential harmful implication on professionals' practice, especially in the context of intake process and primary diagnostic. The effect of familiarity is also discussed in light of the study's findings.\nHIGHLIGHTS: • The perception of mental health professionals toward role playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons is understudied. • Social Workers' perception was measured in regard to the connection between use of RPGs and DSM-IV-TR psychopathology. • Greater knowledge of RPGs was found to be associated with lower perception of the connection between use of RPGs and DSM-IV-TR psychopathology.",

Their distinct anatomical characteristics and the variations therein among the recognized “species” of dragons make the taxa appropriate models for basic phylogenetic analysis in an undergraduate general biology or systematics class. The wyvern, an obviously more primitive, distant cousin of the “true” dragons, is also an appropriate outgroup for these estimations of shared evolutionary history. Separating metallic from chromatic dragons, the generated tree shows relationships among the species that are consistent with their separation in the Dungeons & Dragons games according to alignment, scale color, and religion, three characters that are not used in the analysis. Manual construction of a character matrix and cladogram of dragons followed by repetition of this process via conventional computer software allows the students to track their progress not only in terms of understanding such concepts as choice of character states and parsimony but also in terms of the applicability of said software.",

		"abstract": "Play and learning have always been closely interrelated ideas, with games historically being utilized as social constructs that are simultaneously pedagogical and entertaining in intent. This dissertation will examine an underappreciated element of gaming's pedagogical history through thinking about English composition education as a kind of gaming. Whereas much recent research about gaming has focused on the promises of digital games, I will focus on an older and more fluid type of gaming represented by Tabletop Role Playing Games. In the modern day, Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs), like the well-known game Dungeons & Dragons, represent a combination of traditional and innovative play that foreshadows where and how educators might make use of play-based learning.\nIn my first chapter, I will present the evolution and history of TRPGs from strategic wargaming into a higher and more complex form of general interactive simulation and gameplay. In so doing, I will demonstrate that games and play are an inherently educational form of activity, and have always been so in almost every manifestation.\nIn my second chapter, I take a closer look at gameplay, and what makes it motivational, social, and effective as a form of pedagogy that could be readily incorporated into the classroom. I highlight the three most pertinent advantages which TRPGs can offer to modern students and educators: the harnessing of student engagement, the encouraging of role-play and personal agency-driven learning, and the creation of authentic contexts within which learning may take place.\nIn my third chapter, I offer the composition classroom as a perfect example of a learning context wherein game-based learning can be of use to students and educators. I note the ways in which TRPGs benefit compositional learning, particularly in the case of the First-Year Writing and genre-based composition courses in higher education.\nIn my fourth chapter, I present a model for introducing TRPGs into the composition classroom, using The Quiet Year as a structural example for a First-Year Writing course activity. I conclude by describing my own experiences running TRPGs in educational environments, and the benefits which such a game-based approach can offer.",

		"abstract": "Classroom role-play is an interactive learning technique with a long history of success, but current attempts to augment it with technology limit the very interactions that make this technique successful. For example, digital role-play games often engage individual students at a computer, rather than creating rich social interactions among students. In order to design interactions that better support the core aspects of classroom role-play, we conducted interviews with teachers; we also interviewed role-play gamers to discover how traditional RPG techniques and technology can be used to enhance classroom role-play. In this paper we 1) explore the reasons instructors choose role-play for learning, such as giving students practice opportunities; 2) identify barriers to instructors using classroom role-play activities, such as time constraints and student discomfort; 3) report issues around integrating technology, such as the benefit of reducing cognitive load and the threat of distraction; and 4) highlight two areas where insights from role-playing games can inform the design of interactive learning systems for classroom role-play: by providing methods for emphasizing group success over individual achievement and by preserving the spirit of the experience.",

		"abstract": "Introduction. A study was conducted into tabletop roleplaying games, using theoretical lenses from both information research and tabletop roleplaying game research, to observe the complexity of the relationship between the players and the official rulebooks. Method. A series of qualitative interviews was conducted with two groups of tabletop roleplaying gamers (a large, established group and a smaller, group of less experienced players) based on how they interact with the source material (the rulebooks). Analysis. Coded transcripts were analysed for trends and patterns of discourse, and the theoretical perspective of sense-making (from information research) was applied, to provide meaning to two common and related discursive frameworks from tabletop roleplaying research: the divide between ludologists (or role players); and how illicit knowledge is constructed through metagaming. Results. The study found the discursive frameworks surrounding metagaming and the role/roll player divide to be less a dividing factor and more a concept all players grasped with in the project of co-creating a fantastic reality: a sense-making process. Conclusions. From the point of information research, the study found that tabletop roleplaying games are an example of an information-rich leisure activity that allows and encourages its participants to ignore the official rules surrounding it. From the point of view of tabletop roleplaying game literature, the study casts doubt on the role/roll player dyad commonly adopted by theorists.",

We hypothesize that, in a non-high-tech industry, a sponsor giving access to its technical knowledge may impact industry structure. Based on a survey of the U.S. tabletop role-playing game (RPG) industry, our results highlight that the introduction of an open system in a sector creates an entry induction phenomenon and that these new entrants adopt more readily the open system than incumbents. Moreover, the average size of the firms in the industry decreases due to vertical specialization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

Cette déclaration, bien ancrée dans l’histoire du jeu de plateau, semble tout à fait adéquate pour tout type de jeu. Donjons & Dragons, le premier jeu de rôle tel qu’on le connait à titre de divertissement populaire, a maintenant plus de 40 ans. Le jeu vient de démocratiser le design de son système de règles dans sa 5e édition dans l’espoir de plaire autant à l’expert qu’au néophyte. Il propose par endroits des remakes de scénario ayant atteint un statut de \"classique\" pour profiter du sentiment de nostalgie certes, mais aussi pour actualiser son matériel aux nouveaux standards des rôlistes, évoquant ainsi la pratique du redesign.\n\nEmpruntant une approche constructiviste, nous offrirons une comparaison du contexte et contenu de lignées de scénarios ayant traversé le temps: Ravenloft (Hickman et Hickman 1983) et House on Gryphon Hill (Hickman et Hickman 1986) tous deux réimaginés dans Curse of Stradh (Crawford et al. 2016) et Tomb of Horrors (Gygax 1978) repris dans Tales of the Yawning Portal (Carter, Crawford et Mohan 2017). Notre réflexion s’articulera alentour du contexte culturel et ludique de l’apparition de ces scénarios ainsi qu’autour des changements dans les quatre composantes du montage de jeu de rôle d’Olivier Caïra (2007): soit l’univers (le monde fictionnel), le système de règles (design de jeu), le scénario (interactif) et les personnages (non-joueurs et joueurs).»",

Collaboratively authored by more than 50 key scholars, it traces the history of RPGs, from wargaming precursors to tabletop RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons to the rise of live action role-play and contemporary computer RPG and massively multiplayer online RPG franchises, like Fallout and World of Warcraft. Individual chapters survey the perspectives, concepts, and findings on RPGs from key disciplines, like performance studies, sociology, psychology, education, economics, game design, literary studies, and more. Other chapters integrate insights from RPG studies around broadly significant topics, like transmedia worldbuilding, immersion, transgressive play, or player–character relations. Each chapter includes definitions of key terms and recommended readings to help fans, students, and scholars new to RPG studies find their way into this new interdisciplinary field.",

		"abstract": "Game historians usually trace the literary roots of role-playing games to J. R. R. Tolkien and other fantasy authors. In this article, the author argues that, although Tolkien indeed provided pioneer game creators with specific content, historians have missed the important early influence on game history of children’s literature that advocates and illustrates role playing. Game scholars nod to such child’s play as make-believe and playground games, they often cite accounts of personal experiences in the childhood play of game designers, and they credit game books as an interactive link to fiction, but they have not included children’s texts in their histories. The author argues for placing children’s novels in such histories, particularly Zilpha Keatley Snyder’s The Egypt Game, which this article describes in full as a cultural forerunner in the history of role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons.",

Since the late 20th century, Western society has undergone a “ludification,” as the influence of game-playing has grown ever more prevalent. At the same time, new theories of postmodernism have emphasized the importance of interactive, playful behavior. Core concepts of postmodernism are evident in pen-and-paper role-playing, such as Dungeons and Dragons. Exploring the interrelationships among narrative, gameplay, players and society, the author raises questions regarding authority, agency and responsibility, and discusses the social potential of RPGs in the 21st century.",

An expert panel of RPG bloggers, editors, and game designers judged the hundreds of blog posts that were nominated to the anthology, but only the most thought provoking and highest value nominees were chosen. Open Game Table also includes a Foreword written by RPG luminary Wolfgang Baur, as well as an introduction to the RPG Bloggers Network.

		"abstract": "Foreword by Justin Achilli. Through the combined efforts of over 70 authors, artists, editors, and fans of RPG blogs - Volume 2 of Open Game Table has finally arrived! Inside you will find timeless interviews with Dave Arneson on the roots of roleplaying games, Robin D. Laws on RPG theory and game play, and Jonathan Roberts on his career as a master cartographer. The gaming community nominated nearly 400 articles for this volume, but the finalist were hand-picked by an independent panel of reviewers, and vetted by an experienced editorial board of RPG bloggers.Included in Volume 2 are over 60 blog articles that serve as the perfect complement to Volume 1: a chapter on playing RPGs with kids, a chapter on lies and mischief at the game table; and numerous articles aimed at gaming advice for campaign and adventure design, sandboxing, story pacing, play styles, and much much more. A true indy-press triumph. About Volume 1, WIRED.com's GeekDad blog says Volume 1 is \"... a treasure trove. A tome worth killing a few orcs for.\" and \"The kind of brain stimulus role players need, diverse and quality content.\" Bards & Sages Fantasy Review says \"Open Game Table, Volume 1 is the reference guide equivalent of a Deck of Many Things, ... you can draw from it again and again.\" Open Game Table, Volume 2 brings that same level of excellence back to the table, and never misses a roll.",

While other teenagers were being coolly rebellious, Mark—and twenty million other boys in the 1970s and ’80s—chose to spend his adolescence pretending to be a warrior, an evil priest, or a dwarf. He had discovered Dungeons & Dragons, and his life would never be the same. No longer would he have to settle for being Mark Barrowcliffe, an ordinary awkward teenager from working-class Coventry, England; he could be Alf the Elf, Foghat the Gnome, or Effilc Worrab, an elven warrior with the head of a mule. This is an hilarious memoir of an adolescence spent entirely in the world of fantasy.",

The game, Sign, directs players to create a signed language collaboratively, and thus forces them to pay attention to the subtle ways in which communication occurs.",

		"abstract": "“Muslims” and “Dungeons & Dragons” are rarely discussed in the same sentence. However, one of the earliest fantasy role-playing games, which left a lasting impact on the industry, was the brainchild of Muhammad Abd al-Rahman (Phillip) Barker (1929-2012), a professor of South Asian Studies, an expert in Native American languages, and an American convert to Islam. Like Tolkien, Barker created an enormous fantasy world; however, unlike Tolkien, his world was redolent with Native American and South Asian cultural and religious influences. Through this world, he shared with his fans a nuanced understanding of non-Western societies, cultures, and beliefs – the facets of the human experience that truly constitute multiculturalism. While fictional religion in role-playing games has been feared and condemned, fictional religion (and occultism) plays a pivotal role in Barker’s work; an exploration of his approach towards fictional religion also sheds more light on the question of why fantasy role-playing games came across as competitors towards religion. Barker’s fantasy world brought people of diverse backgrounds together in a beautiful demonstration of how fantasy and science fiction can bring about intercultural and interreligious tolerance in an otherwise intolerant world. Given the centrality of games such as Dungeons & Dragons to American popular culture, an exploration of Barker’s legacy can also be seen in the light of the study of the history and contributions of Muslims in America. © 2017 Hartford Seminary.",

This evolution is discussed by means of the “classic” Gamism-Narrativism-Simulationism model, and with reference to the history of RPGs in the English-speaking world. Even though they reached Poland 20 years after their birth, when simulationism and diceless storytelling were well-known abroad, Magia i Miecz did not import all playing styles at once. Instead, Polish RPGs went through the same developmental stages as in the USA: from gamism, across simulationism and narrativism, to diceless storytelling to dice-friendly storytelling and New Style  /  indie.",

		"abstract": "A learner's capability to critically reflect on an ongoing or newly accomplished learning experience, shapes their own proficiency to further connect previous knowledge to build on and construct rich meaning from new assignments (Zimmerman, 2002). These meaningful insights are essential for learners, allowing them to consider knowledge learned and apply relevant skills into different contexts and settings at a later date. Self-reflection allows students to develop their metacognition skills and work towards a practice that encourages continuous learning. Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), a table-top roleplaying games system developed by Gygax and Arneson (1974), utilises a host of game mechanics such as, but not limited to: character creation, customisation, skills development, leveling over time, story-telling and a game-masters feedback. Many of the game mechanics in D&D, require the player to self-reflect on behalf of their character and continually assess how they wish their character to develop for future game sessions. Coupled with interactive feedback (visual/written/auditory/narrative-development) that is provided throughout each game session from a game master who leads the players through a pre-developed story, the basis of the mechanics provides some similarities to a facilitator leading learners through an assignment. By remixing D&D with Self-Reflection and formative assessment principles, the authors present a playful example of how roleplaying games can be used as a basis to develop lifelong learning skills. This paper presents the design, method and mid-pilot feedback of the Remixed D&D: Reflection and Assessment system. The authors present a discussion of the next stage of the pilot trials and present their considerations of future work.",

		"abstract": "The practice of self-reflection for some students is often thought of as tedious and more often than not, even though the benefits of self-reflection have long been documented, little time is given (to the fault of both students and educators) to building upon the necessary skills required for aiding this process. Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), a table-top roleplaying games system developed by Gygax and Arneson, utilises a host of game mechanics such as, but not limited to: character creation, customisation, skills development, leveling over time, story-telling and a game-masters feedback. Many of the game mechanics in D&D, require the player to self-reflect on behalf of their character and continually assess how they wish their character to develop for future game sessions. Coupled with interactive feedback (visual/written/auditory/narrative-development) that is provided throughout each game session from a game master who leads the players through a pre-developed story, the basis of the mechanics provides some similarities to a facilitator leading learners through an assignment. In this paper, the authors present a playful example of how roleplaying games can be used to facilitate student self-reflection. A discussion of the design, method and mid-pilot feedback of n = 11 students undertaking the Dungeons & Dragons Self-Reflection Tool is presented alongside next stage pilot trials and considerations of future work.",

		"abstract": "This chapter outlines the creation and implementation of a third-grade student-initiated, teacher-directed game design project. The project was initially undertaken to address challenges faced within the classroom, including students’ lack of interest and confidence in math and the math program itself. The students decided that they would like to adapt Dungeons and Dragons for their classroom project, which presented a unique opportunity to integrate the content and skill objectives in math, social studies, and writing into the design and play of the game. Students decided which elements of the game to adapt, what steps to take to achieve these goals, and how to play their game. The teacher provided materials, asked questions, and assessed the students’ progress to ensure that these cross-curricula goals were achieved. While all of the students benefited from engaging with this project, significant positive outcomes were observed in many students who struggled in math, reading, writing, and social interaction.",

They take a fundamental form of play – make-believe – and a fundamental aspect of social reality and identity – roles – and give them the structured form of a game. RPGs involve play. Play transforms and recombines other, functional behaviors, exaggerating, varying, and rendering them incomplete so they lack their \"serious\" consequences and thus their obvious instrumental or survival value. RPGs involve roles, another universal human phenomenon that has been studied for over a century. Roles are patterns of behaviors and attitudes expected from a person occupying a given social position. In terms of play, RPGs provide insight into adult pretense and role-play, which occur in many places besides RPGs: many board, card, and video games have moments of emergent micro-role-play. The chapter also presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in this book.",

		"abstract": "Role-playing games (RPGs) are the most contentious game phenomenon: the exception, the outlier, the not-quite-a-game game. In their foundational game studies text Rules of Play, Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman acknowledge that their definition of a game considers RPGs a borderline case. When scholars, designers, and fans use the words \"role-playing games\", they typically do not speak about all phenomena called \"role-playing games\" but usually refer to one of several clusters of phenomena, which we call forms. The empirical phenomena referred to as \"role-playing games\" are very heterogeneous, spanning different socio-material assemblages: joint talk and paper inscriptions, joint embodiment, and single and networked computing devices. Role-playing games is a word used by multiple social groups to refer to multiple forms and styles of play activities and objects revolving around the rule-structured creation and enactment of characters in a fictional world. However, because \"role-playing games\" is a social category created by humans, it has no unchanging, context-independent essence.",

I relied on something that was familiar to me in order to feel comfortable in class and it soon became my most noticeable characteristic as a professor. Based on active learning methodologies, I use narratives and storytelling to structure my classes as Dungeons & Dragons campaigns. It helped students to connect theory and practice and to understand complex/abstract concepts as this strategy allows me to catch student’s attention and to provide context, relevance, and meaningful connections between what they are studying and their real lives.",

We offer examples of middle school students building science fiction explanations to justify their decisions during a week-long role-playing game (RPG) design workshop. Findings show how worldbuilding---that is, defining the game's setting, history, and characters---supported students in formulating relevant science questions, integrating various science ideas into complex mechanistic explanations, and articulating and critiquing ideas. They also show the challenges students faced in balancing fiction and science to create credible game worlds; and how differences in participation affected collaborators' ultimate abilities to explain. We conclude that RPG design has many affordances as a science learning environment, but also particular caveats for formal educators to bear in mind.",

Several studies have been developed in order to understand these phenomena and find solutions to these problems. This paper begins with a brief contextualization of the current Brazilian situation and some challenges regarding relationships in Brazilian high schools. Suggesting that it may be possible to promote companionship and common well-being in the school environment through the use of games, this study also brings a report of two workshops held in an educational institution in southern Brazil in which Role-playing Game (RPG) was used for educational purposes. From this experience, it is possible to make some considerations about the use of this kind of game and its potential.",

Typically, however, these games are specifically designed to focus upon an exact facet of learning. Examples include the replication or simulation of certain scenarios, establishing focus upon an affective objective, or presenting content in an alternative manner. Rather than utilize a game for a purpose described above, this article explores two unique possibilities. First, that by using an established role-playing game (RPG) as a learning activity, it is possible to reinforce key social learning constructs desired in educational settings that can regularly only be taught in non-optimal settings. Second, the game itself can serve as a platform for the new type of learning desired in the future of education. In the discussion, the author theorizes if these two possibilities are evident, the future of education may be at a crossroads where it is necessary to reconsider our educational objectives.",

Unlike other fantasy worlds, such as J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, Blackmoor is a living world that is being explored to this day. Secrets of Blackmoor investigates the origins of the role playing game, through candid interviews, archival footage, and newly discovered artifacts. In 1964, David Wesely becomes a founding member of a club that includes history buffs, model makers, and miniature collectors. Hiding within the group, however, are a bunch of college students who are interested in war gaming. Within a year, the gamers meet a high school kid named Dave Arneson who is playing war games with his friends in his parents' basement. These gamers have no idea that they will change the face of this hobby forever. Their only concern for now, is how to simulate the reality of war, and above all, they just want to have fun. Their voracious hunt for new rules and knowledge leads them to the University of Minnesota Library where they discover an old manuscript, Strategos; the American Game of War. Within the dense pages are a few sentences that inspire them. The influence of Strategos changes how they play their war games. But are they really following these old rules, or have they stumbled onto something truly unique by misinterpreting what it says? Should a game be constrained by rules, like Monopoly, or should there be no boundaries at all, like a game of make believe? One thing is very clear--something magical was going on in the Twin Cities.",

		"abstract": "Background. The history of larp, live-action role-play, in Japan may be rather short but documents exponential growth in the entertainment sector as well as in educational gaming. Following trends of related forms of analog role-playing games, the horror genre functions as a motor of increasing popularity., Aim. This article explores the development of non-digital role-playing games in the Japanese context in light of the online video platform niconico popularizing horror role-playing and practical considerations of adopting the genre to live-action play., Method. Cyberethnographic fieldwork including participant observation at larps between 2015 and 2018 forms the data basis for this article, followed by qualitative interviews with larp organizers, larp writers, and designers of analog games as well as observations online in respective webforums., Results. Replays, novelized transcripts of play sessions, have been an entry point into analog role-playing in Japan since the 1980s. With the advent of video sharing sites, replays moved from the book to audio-visual records and a focus on horror games. Creating a fertile ground for this genre, the first indigenous Japanese larp rulebook built on this interest and the ease of access, namely that players do not need elaborate costumes or equipment to participate in modern horror., Discussion. The dominant form of larps in Japan are one-room games, that work well with horror mysteries and function as a low threshold of accessibility. Furthermore, the emotional impact of horror larps, the affective interaction between players and their characters, allows for memorable experiences and so continues to draw in new players and organizers.",

Additionally, this study sought to determine what role or roles educators should play in developing the gaming culture of teenage students. In order to answer these questions, seven people who played TRPGs as teenagers were interviewed about their past and current TRPG interests, past and current leisure reading habits, and the effects that playing TRPGs had on their literacy skills. This study revealed that all participants felt that playing TRPGs improved at least one literacy skill and that greater depth and breadth of TRPG experience helped some participants to surmount real or perceived difficulties with reading or speaking; TRPGs also helped participants improve listening skills . In most cases, playing TRPGs also led to a greater quantity of leisure reading. However, TRPGs did not appear to influence which genres participants read; some who previously read fantasy appreciated the connections they saw in TRPGs; yet others did not see TRPGs relating to their reading interests. While some participants saw their schooling and TRPG interests overlap, none saw a need for educators to take an active role in encouraging TRPG gaming among students.",

Composé de plusieurs sous-projets, nous nous intéressons ici à EdUTeam Wargames. Notre communication, issue d’un travail encore très exploratoire, puisque les premiers travaux sur ce type de jeux datent de juillet 2019, souhaite répondre à la problématique suivante : comment les wargames peuvent-ils contribuer à l’apprentissage expérientiel du management ? Pour se faire, nous rendons compte de la mise en place systématique de wargames au sein de chaque séance d’un cours d’introduction au management en 2ème année de Licence à l’IAE Gustave Eiffel (Université de Paris-Est Créteil, UPEC) afin de proposer aux étudiant·e·s des situations managériales réalistes, maîtrisées et à la complexité croissante.\n\nLes résultats les plus importants de cette implémentation originale concernent l’articulation réussie entre les situations managériales réalistes générées par les scénarios des jeux, le corpus de connaissances théoriques de base indispensable à tout futur manager et un référentiel de compétences créé spécifiquement sur la base du référentiel de la fiche répertoire national des certifications professionnelles (RNCP) du diplôme de Licence en Gestion. Pour autant, nous avons rencontré plusieurs obstacles qu’il conviendra d’étudier plus en profondeur : la dimension éthique des wargames, l’évaluation des compétences, la barrière de la langue puisque la grande majorité des jeux est en langue anglaise et la complexité des règles.",

		"abstract": "This study investigates the use of imaginative role-play games to sponsor positive development in young adult moral reasoning. Twelve college students participated in six approximately 4-hour gaming sessions using a customized game system based on Dungeons & Dragons™ (D&D, 1974, 4th ed.). The games contained embedded social/moral dilemmas (e.g., whether to torture a prisoner for information) that participants encountered and had to work through as a group. Significant growth in moral development, as measured with the Defining Issues Test and the Self-Understanding Interview was demonstrated in the gaming groups, but was not replicated in two control groups, who did not participate in the gaming sessions. This suggests that imaginative role-play gaming structures can function as an engaging, interactive “moral training ground,” a medium that promotes moral development, and highlights the difference between antisocial and prosocial violence.",

Though the game’s resurgence has been widely discussed in non-academic outlets, it has been neglected in academic literature. While there are many factors motivating renewed and engaged play of D&D, in this paper we draw on our 2019 study of contemporary D&D players to present key contextual factors of the game’s resurgence. Through discussion of our results, we argue that the influence of representations and trends in popular media, reduction of associated stigma, and impact of convergence culture (Jenkins, 2006) on increased game access, have led to the resurgence of D&D according to our participants and shed light on some key reasons for its success in recent years.",

Revenant sur les hommes clés derrière la création de la saga, ce livre se propose également de mettre à jour les éléments constitutifs du mythe.Une analyse en profondeur des trois jeux fondateurs FF I, FF II et FF III, sur la base des trois piliers de la ligne éditoriale de Third, « Création – Univers – Décryptage », ici plus que jamais représentés.EXTRAITTout commence, en 1969, quand Dave Wesely, l’arbitre/référent dans le club de wargame de Dave Arneson, donne des objectifs à ses joueurs. Ceux-ci ne contrôlent plus des armées entières au sein d’une campagne napoléonienne de Strategos : A Series of American Games of War de Charles Adiel Lewis Totten, publié dans les années 1880, mais des personnages, des citoyens de la ville imaginaire de Braunstein. Ainsi qu’aimait à le rappeler feu Arneson, l’expérience est un véritable fiasco ludique : « Les règles étaient ennuyeuses. » Qu’importe, l’idée d’un jeu où chaque participant prendrait la place d’une figurine germe dans son esprit et dans celle de Wesely qui en propose même une variante western. Durant le service militaire de Wesely, à partir de l’été 1971, Arneson reprend les rênes du club et ouvre progressivement ce « modèle » incertain de « jeu » vers la fantasy, vers le nettoyage de donjons et catacombes.À PROPOS DE L'AUTEURRaphaël Lucas cumule plus de treize ans d’expérience dans le domaine du journalisme vidéoludique. D’abord lecteur de Tilt et adorateur d’AHL, il s’oriente ensuite vers un cursus universitaire.Titulaire d’une maîtrise d’Histoire à Paris 1, il devient pigiste chez PC Team, avant de collaborer à Gameplay RPG et à PlayMag. En octobre 2004, il intègre le groupe Future France et travaille pour Joypad, PlayStation Magazine, Consoles + ou encore Joystick — sans compter quelques contributions à des magazines consacrés au cinéma.Aujourd’hui, il a intégré la nouvelle mouture de Jeux Vidéo Magazine et collabore également à la revue The Game. Il est aussi l’auteur de L’Histoire du RPG et coauteur de BioShock. De Rapture à Columbia ainsi que de La Légende Final Fantasy IX, aux éditions Pix’n Love. Plus concrètement, ses genres de prédilection sont le RPG (japonais et occidental), les jeux d’action-aventure, les FPS et quelques bizarreries expérimentales.",

		"abstract": "Role-playing games (RPGs) have a controversial public image in several countries, including Spain. These fears lack a scientific basis, as role-playing games may be useful in education. Educational trends such as gamification are helping to change this perspective, incorporating elements of RPGs in applications like learning management systems (LMS), e.g., Classcraft. Given the increased research interest in this topic, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) report on the state-of-the-art related to RPGs in an Ibero-American education research context. In the study, a comprehensive search is carried out for the most relevant research papers indexed in Latindex, founded through the virtual repository Dialnet for papers between 2010 and 2019 in the field of education. The search chain was &lsquo;role-playing games&rsquo;, erasing those topics not related. Results show that there are several relevant references, even though they do not seem to have had a great impact. It can be concluded that there is an interest in RPGs in education, especially in Spain, but their potential is still to be developed.",

While dice are fundamental to such games, the examination of dice as objects of design has not been explored. This study examines fifty-nine participants (thirty familiar with the D20 set system) and asks them to examine two 7-die sets commonly used in D&D, the first set being a common set of polyhedrons, and the other set designed to replicate the objects used by a Wizard. It examines the fairness perceptions of the participants and finds that players who have experience with the polyhedral set in the past are more likely to accept the fairness of Wizard dice, and that all players are more likely to accept the fairness of the Wizard set after a play session.",

Pour ce mémoire, un jeu de rôle a donc été expérimenté en classe de 1ère ES afin d'analyser les apprentissages permis par cette pratique. Il s'agit du jeu de rôle Cuba 1962, simulant la crise de Cuba pendant la guerre froide, opposant des acteurs du conflit, interprétés par les élèves. En tant qu'élèves-acteurs, ils ont dû prendre des décisions pour résoudre la crise de Cuba, notamment pendant les négociations, et ainsi comprendre que les hommes du passé étaient des acteurs. Ces décisions déterminaient le futur des personnages qu'ils interprétaient. Ainsi, ils ont pu comprendre que ces hommes du passé avaient un futur incertain. Ce jeu a pu simuler une histoire différente et soulever un large champ des possibles, qui auraient pu advenir en octobre 1962. En comparant après le jeu, leur résultat avec la réalité historique, les élèves ont pu constater l'incertitude de cet événement du passé, dépendant de l'action des hommes.",

		"abstract": "« Le jeu est le refoulé des études littéraires », écrit Michel Picard en 1986. A la suite de cette remarque, nous souhaitons envisager, dans une démarche didactique, l’articulation du jeu et de la lecture d’une œuvre patrimoniale complexe en cours de français. Il s’agit de (ré)concilier la sphère ludologique et la sphère didactique de la littérature en proposant un dispositif de lecture qui permette à tous les lecteurs, et même les plus faibles, de lycée général, de lire une tragédie racinienne. Nous défendons la thèse que le jeu de rôle explicite, au sein de la classe, le jeu de la lecture, à la fois intime et social, faisant alors apparaître, autour d’un texte scolaire, obligatoire et difficile, un véritable plaisir de la lecture partagé entre pairs. Il nous semble voir là une piste, dans le prolongement de la recherche didactique et des travaux sur le sujet-lecteur, pour motiver la lecture d’œuvres patrimoniales. Tout d’abord, nous définissons l’immersion fictionnelle, source de plaisir commune à la lecture et au jeu de rôle. Puis, nous avons observé comment la question de la motivation a été envisagée au sein de la didactique de la littérature pour engager les élèves tout en con-sidérant l’œuvre patrimoniale comme un objet d’enseignement. Enfin, nous avons pensé précisé-ment le jeu de rôle comme point de rencontre entre la ludologie et les études littéraires. Notre attention s’est portée sur la lecture des tragédies raciniennes en classe, œuvres au statut en partie éminemment scolaire qui sont difficiles et éloignées des jeunes lycéens. Ensuite, nous présentons un dispositif de lecture qui modifie en profondeur le cheminement de la lecture, associant la tragédie classique à une partie de jeu de rôle : la lecture devient collaborative entre pairs,réunis en « cercles de personnage ».Nos travaux présentent les résultats d’une recherche exploratoire menée dans quatre classes de lycée général. Nous formulons l’hypothèse qu’un tel dispositif ludique permet non seulement de motiver la lecture auprès de tous les lycéens, même les non-lecteurs, mais leur donne aussi la possibilité de s’approprier personnellement le texte au sein de la collectivité de la classe tout en développant des compétences.",

Our group still gathers regularly and our adventures have become legend, at least in our minds. In fact, of the seven of us, six are still playing and we have added an additional four players to our group. The resurgence of tabletop Role-playing Games (RPGs), and their explosion into new media, which we have participated in and enjoyed, invites us to consider their place in redefining remix culture in the twenty-first century. In this chapter we outline our observations as we:\n\nArticulate the nature of RPGs as a site of remix.\n\nArticulate the ways that tabletop role-players remix using the tools of the digital humanities. Access to diverse materials through digital technology turns role-play-ing gamers, not only scholars, but also everyday people, into remixers.\n\nDemonstrate contemporary remix through narrative inquiry into the practices of a successful group of online role-playing gamers, broadcast on Twitch as Critical Role.",

Using a mixed-methods approach, this ISDiP follows a team of invested school community members as they planned, implemented, studied, and reflected on the outcomes of initiating targeted social and emotional learning interventions to 16 students from a small alternative school in Anchorage, Alaska. Through a 90-day cycle, the School's Network Improvement Community (NIC) organized and executed an after-school SEL club after data on a district-wide survey indicated that social and emotional learning (SEL) was a necessary focus for the school context. The NIC utilized a self-assessment SEL screener, anecdotal observations, as well as parent, teacher, and student testimonies to justify the outcomes of this study. The researcher found that tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) are a viable, effective, and fun way to help students develop their social and emotional skills. This result was evident based on the mySAEBRS survey results, which demonstrated an average increase of 6.6% across all participants. This data was justified further by the anecdotal observations made by a diverse pool of stakeholders. Based on these results, the NIC was able to expand the SEL/TTRPG intervention to their entire school community and would like to encourage other school contexts to do so as well.",

In Game Wizards, Jon Peterson chronicles the rise of Dungeons & Dragons from hobbyist pastime to mass market sensation, from the initial collaboration to the later feud of its creators, Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. As the game's fiftieth anniversary approaches, Peterson—a noted authority on role-playing games—explains how D&D and its creators navigated their successes, setbacks, and controversies.Peterson describes Gygax and Arneson's first meeting and their work toward the 1974 release of the game; the founding of TSR and its growth as a company; and Arneson's acrimonious departure and subsequent challenges to TSR. He recounts the “Satanic Panic” accusations that D&D was sacrilegious and dangerous, and how they made the game famous. And he chronicles TSR's reckless expansion and near-fatal corporate infighting, which culminated with the company in debt and overextended and the end of Gygax's losing battle to retain control over TSR and D&D.With Game Wizards, Peterson restores historical particulars long obscured by competing narratives spun by the one-time partners. That record amply demonstrates how the turbulent experience of creating something as momentous as Dungeons & Dragons can make people remember things a bit differently from the way they actually happened.",

Eighty-five people ages 18-25 were surveyed on their perceived levels of these three variables, as well as how often they played TTRPGs. Responses of those who did play TTRPGs were compared with results of those who did not play TTRPGs. A statistically significant positive correlation was identified in all participants between creativity and self-efficacy, creativity and social skills, and self-efficacy and social skills. Participants who played TTRPGs scored statistically significantly higher in measures of creativity than participants who did not play TTRPGs. There was no statistically significant difference in the two groups in terms of self-efficacy or social skills. These findings, along with previous studies concentrating on possible benefits of TTRPGs, suggest that there is a strong relationship between creativity and playing TTRPGs, and further investigation into ways TTRPGs could be implemented in the treatment of autistic patients are warranted.",

BADD was a group consisted of parents, teachers, and clergy who were worried about the spiritual and mental development of children, who they saw were at risk of being corrupted by a single game—Dungeons & Dragons. The group campaigned again and again, warning fellow parents about the detrimental effect that this game could have on a child’s life. They believed Dungeons & Dragons had a kind of power over its players—a power that could create meaning and even take children to their eternal doom. This is just one argument for the idea that tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons have the power to create meaning in a person’s life and influence their development. However, BADD was misinformed on how this meaning was created and how an individual’s development can be impacted by these games",

There are numerous avenues for scientists to get stories into the media; however, scientists need to become better at communicating their research in plain English. Media which are supportive of science stories or programs should be targeted and scientists should become more active at pitching stories. (AQES) The Rolling Stories project turns the AQES call to target media which are supportive of ‘science stories’ into a design activity where scientists are encouraged to both tell their stories and communicate them through creating Table-top Role Playing Games (TRPGs) and then playing them with students. The project goals support the AQES goals  of increasing student participation, public engagement and scientists’ participation. The project expects outcomes in terms of increased engagement through the workshop series and long-lasting outcomes in the form of TRPG game books that can then be shared and re- used in educational and professional contexts.",

		"abstract": "\"Playing With Dragons: Using Role-playing Games to Support Academic Objectives\" explores how table role-playing games might positively impact the attainment of classroom learning objectives. This paper begins with an exploration of what a table role-playing game is, and compares it to educational theatre techniques, primarily process drama. While there is a significant amount of research being done in how online computer games can be used to benefit the classroom, there is a dearth of research being done on table role-playing games. I argue that, as a non-digital interactive experience run by a facilitator, table role-playing games share a great deal of commonality with the methodology used to implement process drama. However, table role-playings normally do not concern themselves with the specific positive outcomes regarding student learning. In this case study, I design a table role-playing game for a high school English class studying Sophocles' The Antigone, intended to help a classroom instructor achieve specific, targeted objectives. Before implementing the game in the classroom, I describe the revision and modifications that were made to the game after implementing a trial playtest with adult participants. The revised game was then enacted in the high school classroom, and I provide a detailed report of the significant interactions. Upon completion of the game sessions, all participants are interviewed to share their experience and insights into using the table role-playing game and how it impacted their understanding of the text. I conclude this study with my findings, which demonstrate that table role-playing games can be successfully used in the classroom. The next logical step will be to determine what the best practices are, and in what ways the game design methodology can be improved upon.",

		"abstract": "Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) has been a pervasive force in American culture for over forty years, and while it has frequently been examined as both social practice and cultural text, rarely have both the texts and the praxis of D&D been studied with a focus on how race and gender interact within the game. This research looks at how race and gender intersect (or more often, contrast) within the text and practice of D&D.\nThis study culls data from a wide variety of sources. It includes literary analyses of important source material for the game, such as the work of J.R.R. Tolkien and Robert E. Howard, describing the way these authors influenced the way the game understands and uses race. It also examines later works that both influence and have been influenced by Dungeons & Dragons. This includes texts like Steven Erikson’s Malazan Book of the Fallen, a fantasy epic that began as a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. In addition to textual analyses, this study includes data and observations taken from interviewing players and observing numerous sessions of D&D. These interviews and observations are essential, as they provide information on how people talk, act, and think around the gaming table, and how players engage critically with concepts of race and gender in and out of the game. The ethnographic work in this study also provides critical information on the characteristics of D&D gaming groups as social units, and how the social qualities of those groups impact the messages imparted during play.\nThe basic conclusion of this study is that knowing that someone plays D&D means very little, while understanding how and why they play D&D is highly informative. While both\nii\nD&D’s origin as a game and its literary basis are marked by a predominance of white male voices, there is a surprising amount of flexibility in the stories that players can tell. While there is no guarantee that players will use their narrative freedom to tell morally uplifting stories (and they often do not) a great deal can be learned from understanding why people enjoy specific tropes and concepts.",

Heralded as a return to form by conservative Christians, the Satanic Panic ousted occult undertones lurking in the shadows of America’s popular culture. Conservative Christians subjected Dungeons & Dragons to the burning stake of this modern-day witch hunt. This thesis investigates the “why” and “how” of the Satanic Panic vis-à-vis this tabletop role-playing game set in a fantasy universe. Applying an interdisciplinary approach, this thesis presents primary texts and historical documents of the Satanic Panic and then proceeds to address the Satanic Panic sociologically. Finally, this thesis performs ideological criticism on an anti-Dungeons & Dragons text to demonstrate historical, sociological, and ideological trends in a major movement within conservative American Christianity, the influence of which reverberates to this day.",

As long as youth entertainment has values that can be seen as going against the established values of the preceding generation, a moral panic could take place. The purpose of this research was to analyze how moral panics centered on youth entertainment begin and gain traction. To do this, the research was focused on the 1980s moral panic around tabletop roleplaying games, specifically Dungeons & Dragons. By tracing the origin of the moral panic to the fear of cults and occult from the 1970s, we can find more context as to why some individuals believed that role playing games could cause adolescents to use the games as a style of dangerous escapism or as a gateway to the occult. To further understand this moral panic, an analysis of some of the major detractors of role playing games was done, as well as researching the role the media played in cultivating the moral panic. With a greater understanding on how moral panics begin and gain traction, this research can be used to compare and contrast other moral panics around youth entertainment.",

One might even see gaming as an attempt to find friends and build that political community of which Aristotle says friendship is the root. The really interesting thing about gamers is that, as they play Dungeons Dragons, they at one and the same time build bonds between their characters and between each other as players. The trajectory of these bonds often mirrors the trajectory of friendships we find in epic fantasy literature where the characters, at first suspicious of each other, in the end have developed true friendships and established peaceful kingdoms where chaos had reigned before. Aristotle's philosophy of friendship can help us to understand this development. Dungeons Dragons players know a lot about friendship and the value of friendship in a person's life, despite the popular depiction of gamers.",

		"abstract": "The idea of role-playing makes some people nervous – even some people who play role-playing games (RPGs). So the idea of immersion is central to understanding how Dungeons Dragons and other aspects of participatory culture work. Phenomenology is a kind of “philosophy of mind” associated with the works of twentieth-century philosophers Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, among others. The domain of phenomenology encompasses the entire range of experiences in the world, paying attention to what Husserl called “intentionality,” or how our consciousness is directed toward particular objects in the world. The fact that this is presented as an atypical approach to play, or at least one that requires some effort, invites us to ask about typical modes of play if visualization of in-game events is not that mode. This chapter concluded by scratch the surface of a complete phenomenological description of role-playing.",

The chapter highlights philosophy's most enduring and frustrating questions. According to Dungeons Dragons (DD), the alignment is an element of the player's character sheet that clarifies their worldview and moral outlook. It is also a category that can limit character class and an aura that allows spells or abilities to detect a character's moral outlook – and if necessary “smite” that evil (or good) into oblivion. The DD attracts imaginative players. A party is likely be filled with virtuous paragons, nefarious knaves, and pragmatists.",

Socrates and Plato simply deny the possibility. What does this mean for DungeonsDragons (DD)? First of all, it means that nobody chooses evil for the sake of evil, what some people call diabolic evil. The primary sources of evil are indifference and self-deception. Both lead me to a life of convention, simply living up to the code of conduct given by society. It is much more comfortable to think of evil as something done by villains in movies. There is something rather disturbing about the thought that one can become evil gradually. Because of the influence of bad habits, much about the moral life feels grey and fuzzy.",

That might make some people squirm and worry about gamers. In DD, unlike video games, it typically takes years and years to advance a character to levels of significance. According to Socrates, the life of philosophy is a life of the mind. Or as he would likely put it, a life of the soul. Death, according to Socrates, is “separation of the soul from the body”. This chapter talks about how the death of a PC can be an invitation to think about passion and detachment, and how the creation of a new PC can be an invitation to think about fairness and justice.

The irony for Christian critics of DD, such as Schnoebelen, is that the philosophical and theological arguments of Christian traditionalists, such as Thomas Aquinas and J.R.R. Tolkien, provide some of the strongest arguments in favor of DD role-playing. However, to be fair, these same arguments can be used to argue that a particular DD game, under certain circumstances, can be bad. “Postmodernists” refers loosely to a group of philosophers and thinkers who question, if not outright reject, the core tenets of the traditionalists. If the traditionalists have the correct metaphysics about the real world, then it follows that DD is good, but that care must be taken to make sure the game does not become morally objectionable.",

Dark Sun, Eberron, and the Planar City of Sigil little resemble the history, languages, lands, peoples, and places of Middle Earth, but they follow Tolkien's practice of creating a world in which all these elements are meant to fit together. The first part of fantasy is the human capacity to separate the qualities of things from the things in which they appear, and to imagine them in other things that do not have them. Many Dungeons Dragons campaigns treat magic as a kind of alternate science, but in fairy tales there is more to it than that. Fantasy succeeds when it transports us to an imaginary land, and we escape the grayer parts of our own for a little while.",

Glaucon, one of the conversation partners, decides to play devil's advocate, putting forth the idea that justice is one of those pesky things we have to deal with to live in a peaceful society, arguing that if there were a way around it, no one would be just or moral. The trouble with flat-out calling Menzoberranzan the most unjust state imaginable is that it has some qualities befitting a just state. In addition to justice, Socrates calls for the ideal state and its citizens to embody the virtues of temperance, wisdom, and courage.",

The many worlds of the DD multiverse are overflowing with them – from heroes such as the twin-scimitar-wielding drow Drizzt Do'Urden and the self-sacrificing knight Sturm Brightblade to villains such as the lord of Barovia, the vampire Count Strahd Von Zorovich, Vecna, the lich who rose to demi-godhood, and countless others. However, there is one that stands above all others. It is the Master of Past and Present, Raistlin Majere. This chapter is concerned with a seemingly simple question: who is Raistlin Majere? Of course, he is the brother of Caramon Majere. He is the wizard with golden skin and hourglass pupils. He is the Master of Past and Present. The chapter answers the question of what makes it true that it was a single person that accomplished all of the extraordinary feats that Raistlin did.",

		"abstract": "This chapter focuses on the archetypal image of the necromancer: the black-robed creator and master of the undead. The necromancer is often depicted as a mere cackling villain, using her power over death to forward her evil agenda. In this way, necromancy has been philosophically maligned. Although necromancers were traditionally considered to be evil in Dungeons Dragons (DD), the game came to accommodate the idea that necromancers, in theory, could be neutral, or even good-aligned, with their powers used for the greater good. The distaste for necromancy and its mindless minions is instead a relic of “pre-theoretical intuition” a common-sense belief that may not hold up to philosophical scrutiny. Films and TV series depict the walking dead as ravenous, brain-eating monstrosities. Next to such depictions, the relatively harmless nature of Dungeons Dragons’ mindless undead is easy to overlook.",

		"abstract": "The skill of calling animals to fight brings up unique ethical questions. Mages usually interact with animals in two ways: First, the author can summon animals by using animal-summoning or monster-summoning spells. Second, a mage can summon animals to be familiar. A familiar was once a normal animal that has been transformed into magical beast with unique powers and abilities. Bats, cats, hawks, and rats are examples of common familiar companions. The rights ethicist Tom Regan argues that animals have particular rights because they are subjects of a life, meaning that they seek to satisfy specific preferences and interests. As Lord Acton wrote, “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” It appears that this also holds in Dungeons Dragons (DD). Thus, when playing a character who can summon nonhuman animals, it may be wise to take the ethics into account when deciding what actions are best.",

In frustration, they methodically kill, threaten, and chase away any quest-givers that approach them. The chapter looks at early adventure games based on DD, asking why they avoid many aspects of the game, especially those that involve role-playing and moral decisions by players. It then discusses how gamers now discover DD, and why this is important in changing their understanding of the game. The chapter addresses the question: why Pierre Levy's ideas about the digital age, virtual communities, and collective intelligence are so important for understanding how, and why this has happened. It concludes with discussion of the effects that this has on DD players.",

One would be hard pressed to argue that cartoonishly large breasts and skin-tight leather skirts really allow for dexterous swordplay or quick getaways. DD liberates us from the limitations of our sex by making male and female characters equal in terms of abilities. The shyest of men can be the most outspoken of wizards, the most honest girl can play the most unscrupulous rogue, and the pacifist woman can don full armor and fly into a berserker rage on a group of bugbears ambushing her adventuring party because, after all, bugbears are her species enemy and she just can't help herself when they are around.",

		"abstract": "Larp needs understanding. Understanding requires knowledge. Finding knowledge involves digging into the murky material and getting your hands dirty. Finding understanding requires the will to dissect your own knowledge. \nNearly all writers on larp are avid larpers them selves. This makes the process of finding understanding a lot more difficult than most people outside the field would think. Larp can at its best be intensely emotional and inspirational, even a defining element of ones life. At its worst larp’s just boring. Getting to understand larp demands that the writer is willing to cast aside the fondness they feel for their subject, to evaluate the failures and boring bits. You cannot dissect without taking your subject apart.\nThis is the dissection, here are their findings.\nThis is the third collection of articles for Knutepunkt, the annual Scandinavian Congress on Larp. It is our hope that this book will establish a tradition of an annual book compromising articles on larp. The two former works, As Larp Grows Up, and Beyond Role and Play set the standard for us. Hopefully, we have not put them to shame.",

We do not exist in a vacuum, and neither do our larps. How do we perceive the world? How do we perceive ourselves? What might our larps tell about us, and what kinds of repercussions can they have?\nIn addition to the articles, we wanted the book to reflect other methods of expressing the diverse ways larping might affect us. Therefore, we have included poems submitted by you – both for inspiration and reflection – and we hope that you will enjoy these beautiful contributions as much as we do.",

It emphasizes the subjective psychological interpretations of role-playing through various perspectives, including phenomenology, hobbyist theories, role-play studies, and psychoanalysis. The chapter presents the evidence that can be leveraged from the psychological sciences, based on empirical research in the positivist tradition and the uses and conjectures of other forms of analysis. Cognitive psychology studies the mind and mental function, including learning, memory, attention, perception, reasoning, language, conceptual development, cognitive capacities, and decision-making. Most research on the cognitive effects of games has attempted to understand the links between video game play and aggression. Some see a causal connection, while others refute it. Psychologists have examined why games appear to be highly motivating. Indeed, looking for motivational effects has been one of the more fruitful empirical approaches to the psychological study of games, including digital and analog role-playing games in schools.",

It aims at interpretivist and constructionist approaches to RPGs, focusing first on important concepts such as interaction, identity, role, and frames to then broaden focus to culture as discuss player relations, collaborative action, and rationality. The chapter presents social stratification research that highlights noteworthy trends related to class, education, religion, gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity in RPGs from a realist perspective. Sociologists often study players' experiences and behaviors in and around RPGs. This has to do with what many see as inherently attractive about RPGs – the interactive environments within which groups can collaboratively construct an imagined world and then act in it. RPGs facilitate many different player configurations and types of social interaction. In sociology, \"race\" refers to dividing humans by observable physical characteristics like skin color, while \"ethnicity\" refers to dividing humans by culture.",

It shows how the conversation inside the hobby sought to establish what a role-playing game was or should be, accompanied by a conversation in the mass media that framed role-playing as an activity for youth and made either condescending or alarmist normative judgments about those who engaged in it. It offers those conversations as the context in which two seminal essays written by a tabletop RPG (TRPG) designer named Ron Edwards served as the impetus for the Forge as a place to pursue the internal discourse—in other words, as a place to take role-playing games seriously.",

It describes some of the arguments about GNS that were raised, and describes how GNS fits into the broader ‘Big Model’ of Forge theory as ‘Creative Agenda’ (CA) that functioned as potential orienting principles for a given play group. It presents the Big Model as a kind of frame-analytic approach to understanding the structure of TRPG activity, and suggests that within such an approach, CA serve the useful purpose of allowing that activity to be understood as play. It also discusses the experience of Forge participants in grappling with the Big Model.",

Yet there has been little attention devoted to the meaningful ways RPGs have shaped society at large over the last four decades. RPGs were influential on video game design and have been widely represented in film, television and other media. They have made their mark on other areas of society, as well, including education, social media, corporate training and the military. This collection of new essays illustrates the broad appeal and impact of RPGs. Topics range from a critical reexamination of the Satanic Panic of the 1980s, to the growing significance of RPGs in education, to the potential for \"serious\" RPGs to provoke awareness and social change. The contributors discuss the myriad subtle (and not-so-subtle) ways in which the values, concepts and mechanics of RPGs have infiltrated popular culture.",

Though edu-larp is a rather recent development emerging from the leisure activity of role-playing games, various other spheres have emphasized the pedagogical value of role-playing as a method, including education, theatre, psychodrama, military, business, and health care. This literature review will streamline the discourse surrounding games, simulation, drama, and role-playing with the recent development of edu-larp, emphasizing the various cognitive, affective, and behavioral benefits detailed in the research. The review will also discuss the challenges faced by edu-larp designers and instructors, offering possible solutions.",

Larps can contain\ntriggering content; a trigger reaction is a powerful\nresponse that affects individuals, communities, and\nthe games they play. Lastly, this article considers\nsteps that can help prepare and care for those who\nexperience a triggering reaction at a game event.",

		"abstract": "Role-playing games have evolved into many forms in their thirty-year history. From the\ntraditional pen-and-paper form, that originated with Dungeons and Dragons, with a group of friends\nplaying around a table, to large live-action game, with hundreds of people acting out their assumed roles.\nThe first computer role-playing games appeared over twenty-five years ago and massively multi-player\nrole-playing games, such as World of Warcraft are now one of the most popular genres of digital games.\nDespite this diversity players at least seem to think they know when something is a role-playing game.\nWhen players, writers and game designers say “this is a role-playing game” there are no problems, they\nall seem to know what each other means, what is and is not a role-playing game. Yet there is no commonly\naccepted definition of the form. Understandable, perhaps, given the diversity, but the implicit agreement\nabout its use means that there may well be some common underlying features shared by the various\nexamples.\nHampering any attempt to understand what makes a game a role-playing game is the subtle\ndivide between role-playing and role-playing game. Role-playing can take in many places, not all of them\ngames (such as ritual, social activities, therapy, etc). This means that definitions of the role-playing activity\nare not that useful in separating role-playing games from other games. In this paper we start from the\nposition that the players are correct: they know what a role-playing game is. By examining a range of roleplaying\ngames some common features of them emerge. This results in a definition that is more successful\nthan previous ones at identifying both what is, and what is not, a role-playing game.",

Unfortunately, there are few clear definitions of ‘world’\nas it applies to commercial computer games, or as it could be used to help improvements these games.\nWith that in mind, this paper will explore a framework for defining virtual worlds and then apply it to\nElder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (Figure 1) in terms of phenomenological, social, and cultural aspects.\nEven though it is a single player game, several key features allow Oblivion to be considered as a\nsocial world. Despite these promising features, Oblivion fails as a rich cultural world. It could be\nfurther improved as a social world and perhaps even as a cultural world through various techniques.",

		"abstract": "In the midst of the massive growth in the numbers of people participating in\nmassively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), study of the role-playing within these\ngames is increasingly marginalized, as role-playing servers are developed to segregate player bases\nand as scholars increasingly focus on the non-role-playing aspects of online game play. We seek to\naddress that disconnection by studying relative levels of fulfillment and frequency of tabletop and\nonline role-playing for World of Warcraft (WoW) subscribers.\nFinally, demographic information taken from the players themselves aids in guiding future\nresearch about which type of role-play gamers are more likely to participate in and find fulfilling. By\nlooking at the age, location, and gender of players the relative merits of each type of role-playing is\ndiscussed, pointing to strategies to capitalize on the strengths and minimize the failings of each venue\nfor role-playing. This study aids both the online and offline gaming industry in better understanding\ntheir target role-playing audiences, while providing a grounded study of avid role-players to support.",

		"abstract": "Role-playing games are a diverse phenomenon, ranging from digital games to live\naction role-playing. Finding a definition that suits them all is hard, but attempts have been many. All of\nthe definitions emphasize some aspects of role-playing games like rules, the role of players or the story.\nMany definitions do not describe role-playing games as such, but the activity that is role-playing. This\npaper looks at one of the latest attempts to define role-playing games, by Hitchens and Drachen (2009),\nand shows some potential problems with it. As an answer to these problems another definition is\nproposed, consisting of a game world, participants, shared narrative power and interaction. This\ndefinition is given only after discussing the nature of definitions in general. By drawing from the work of\nWittgenstein, it is shown that definitions are by their nature bound to language in a way Wittgenstein calls\nlanguage-games. Language is constantly changing, as the culture surrounding it changes. There are no\nfinal definitions for role-playing games, only definitions suited better or worse to a certain historical\nunderstanding of role-playing games. However, this does not mean that role-playing games should not be\ndefined, as the definitions given can advance our understanding of what role-playing games are and could\nbe. This paper takes part in the ongoing process of definition.",

The game is a non-traditional,  small-press “indie” game called Ganakagok designed by the author; in the game, the characters are  men and women from a quasi-Inuit culture living on an island of ice in a world lit only by starlight.  As the game begins, the imminent arrival of the Sun is announced, and game-play is about how the  people of this culture deal with the approaching dawn. In one such game, the players of three male  characters went through interesting character arcs in their interactions with each other and with female players; those arcs seemed to depict movement among different models of masculine identity. One implication of the study is that RPGs afford a fruitful site for reflecting upon ideas in discourse,  and so it is possible for role-playing to serve as an aesthetic as well as an expressive medium—as art as well as play, in other words.",

		"abstract": "This article describes sadomasochist role-playing which is physically performed by\nits participants. All sadomasochist activities have a role-playing component to them. It is a form of\nrole-playing where people consensually take on dominant and submissive roles, for the purpose of\ninflicting things such as pain and humiliation, in order to create pleasure for all participants. In some\ncases, participants agree to emphasize those roles, or make them fetishistically attractive, by adding\ncomplexity and definitions to them, and then act them out in semi-scripted fantasy scenes. This paper\nexamines that activity, commonly called “sadomasochistic role-play”, as opposed to the more generic\n“sadomasochism” of which it is only one facet.\nFurthermore, the article compares this form of play with live-action role-playing (larp). Its main\nemphasis is on the question of how closely related the two activities are. To determine this, the article\nexamines sadomasochist role-playing as being potentially a game, the question of its goal-orientation\nand the issue of whether or not it contains a character in the sense of a live-action role-playing\ncharacter. Based on this process, it comes to the conclusion that sadomasochist role-playing is not a\nseparate type of role-playing, but rather one kind of live-action role-playing.\nAs its theoretical framework, this text utilizes studies done on both live-action role-playing games and\non sadomasochist role-playing. Reliable material on the latter being quite limited, descriptions have\nbeen gathered from both academic works and practical manuals. The data gained from these is further\nsupported by interviews of practitioners with personal experience in playing sadomasochist fantasy\nscenes. This article has two key purposes: The research of a relatively understudied form of roleplaying,\nand the building of bridges from that to live-action role-playing research.",

		"abstract": "Because of the endurance of stereotypes about role-playing gamers, much research\nhas been carried out which provides evidence to contradict the stereotype’s prevailing\nmisconceptions. This paper aims to investigate this existing research into the individual differences in\nthose who play role-playing games and provide a comprehensive review of research in the areas of\ndemographics, interests, personality and identity as they pertain to gamers. The goal will be to\ninvestigate the extent to which the common perception of game-players stands up under\ninvestigation. The paper will also attempt to refute some of the more extreme and outrageous claims\nwhich have been made in relation to role-playing games – particularly those which involve crime,\nviolence, murders, suicides and Satanism. The article will also examine child’s play and role-playing\ngames in order to illustrate the importance of this style of imaginary play for identity development for\nboth children and adults.\nThe stereotypical image of role-playing gamers depicts them as anti-social male teenagers who are\nlargely more interested in technology than in their own personal appearance, believing that they are\nhighly intelligent and imaginative, passionate about topics which are uninteresting to their peers, and\nconsequently persecuted by some of these peers. Through an examination of the research carried out in\nthis area, the emerging image of a gamer is in fact that of an individual who does not necessarily fit into\nthe stereotypical demographic of being a young male, and who is actively involved in developing his or\nher own personality and identity through participation in the games and also within the social networks\nthat are often framed by these games.",

		"abstract": "This article sheds light on how different rules systems for tabletop role-playing games\n(TRPGs) impact players’ sense of creativity. It looks at three very different games played by six roleplaying\nensembles, and uses interviews and group discussions to make the players reflect on how they are\ninfluenced by the rules used during play. While the sometimes insular nature of TRPG gaming became\nevident, it was also clear that there are several different phenomena that occur in a TRPG that can be\nlabeled as “creative”. Aiming to provide a tool for discussion on TRPGs, six different types of creativity is\noutlined in the article, as well as a number of different examples of the role that the rules play in\ninfluencing these.",

Embodied cognition theories assume that cognition is\nnot only a feature of the brain, but the body as a whole and it is interaction with the environment it\noperates in. Grounded cognition proposes that an action, perceiving an action, and thinking about an\naction rely on the same processes. Moreover, knowledge is inseparably grounded to bodily states and\nmodalities. Based on the grounded cognition theory and especially embodiment, we argue the character\nimmersion and bleed are natural consequences on how the brain works. Also we illustrate how the\noperation of simulators explains some of the central features in the creation of fiction and it is similarities\nto our everyday experiences. In general, grounded cognition provides a rather simple explanation how\nfiction is experienced as in this theoretical framework action and thinking about an action largely utilize\nthe same brain mechanics and so are phenomenally similar.",

		"abstract": "As texts which are based on collaborative and interactive narration, tabletop – also\nknown as “pen and paper” – role-playing games (TRPGs) are distinct in their technological simplicity.\nIndeed, in their traditional form all they require is the physical presence of a group of players – commonly\naround a table, hence “tabletop” – who collaboratively participate in developing a narrative; and a system\nof rules which allow resolving the outcome of situations in which different levels of chance may be\ninvolved – the need to write down statistic information making them “pen and paper”. Evidently, this\napparent lack of sophistication makes role-playing games – as a clearly contemporary cultural\nphenomenon (cf. Punday, 2005; Nephew, 2004; Harrigan, 2007; Mackay, 2001) – stand out in the context of\na world that is becoming ever more dependent on technology. All the more so, considering the persistence\nof TRPGs in the face of its “descendants” in other more technologically advanced media and despite what\nhas become the popular notion of “the bigger, the faster, the better.” Nevertheless, that which occurs\nduring a role-playing game session – the level of interactivity, player immersion in the narrative, flexibility\nof the rules, etc. - generally surpasses, even today, what many of its “successors” achieve. How does this\noccur? How is it possible; through what mechanisms do TRPGs allow such sophistication when relying\nsolely on the “old fashioned” technologies of (hand-) writing and oral narration? Approaching these\nquestions from the general perspective of literary studies, the following paper problematizes what can be\ncalled a “naïve view” of communication technology by addressing the complex relationship between the\nprinted texts used for role-playing – such as rule- and sourcebooks – and the narratives created during\ngame-play. To do so, it addresses the fundamental influence that framings, such as rules, character sheets\nand setting, as well as paratextual elements contained within or at the borders of these texts, such as cover\nillustrations, prologues and epilogues, just to name a few – have on participants’ interpretation and, most\nimportantly, creation of TRPG narratives.",

The  study also gathered qualitative data from the 23 students in this  convenient sample group regarding their overall experiences with  the edu-larp method.  \n When paired with traditional pedagogy, out of these five  dimensions of student development, the investigators found that  the edu-larp intervention helped increase overall intrinsic  motivation and interest/enjoyment of science in the quantitative  data. The qualitative and quantitative findings merged to reveal  improvement in perceived competence in science. In interviews,  students demonstrated a strong belief that larp aided in the  development of all five dimensions and expressed universal  interest in learning through edu-larp in the future. Overall, the  data suggested that adding the edu-larp component to the  existing science curriculum impacted the experience of students  by increasing interest, engagement, and perceived competence in  science through game play and role enactment.",

This mixed methods study is an investigation of the  use of role-play in an undergraduate university course  designed to prepare students to become public school coaches  and physical education teachers. The five original vignettes  that were role-played were specifically written to prepare the  students to successfully handle situations they might  reasonably encounter in their future work. The role-play  model used in the research was originally created by the  Shaftels in the 1960s, but several creative variations devised  by the current investigators were added to that model for this  study causing it to be an adapted version. Data collected  included questionnaire responses from two different  questionnaires, information from a focus group, and  observations by the two investigators. Investigators concluded  that the students not only exhibited skill in the techniques  used to resolve the issues in the vignettes, but that students  gained confidence the more they participated in the role-plays  which occurred over a 4-week period. The students  themselves reported that learning from one’s peers, trying out  their ideas in a safe environment, being forced to plan an  intended outcome in advance, and hearing feedback from  others were their most valued experiences. They also  overwhelmingly reported preferring role-play to the more  traditional university lecture method.",

		"abstract": "This  paper  introduces an ecological approach to the performance of live action role-playing, commonly referred to as  larping.  Ecology  and ecological, in this context, are not used to explain our relation to nature and its protection, but \nrather our relationship to our surrounding environment and other subjects dwelling in it. The approach was chosen because it provides the study with a comprehensive and an inclusive way of looking at performances. \nLarps can be seen as performances from many points of view: it can mean displaying one’s skills in role-playing or in improvising; it can mean patterning one’s behavior to signify that of a fictional character; or it can mean keeping up a \nvision or expectations of a fictional character. In addition – and what is especially the focus of this paper – the performance of larping can be understood as completing or carrying out actions that constitute the activity called larping. \nTo explain the ecological approach, this paper will first provide the reader with an overview of larps as ecologies, and then dissect the performance of larping into four steps that are essentially connected to each other in the ecology: information pickup, extraction of possibilities, choice-making and embodiment.  To summarize, a larp ecology is a comprehensive interdependent systems where all the players and other organic and non-organic components of the game \nsupport  each other. In this ecology, the players pick up information,  extract  possibilities for  actions from that information, make choices on which possibilities to carry out and embody those choices by applying their bodily repertoire to the performance.",

The paper uses a dramatistic perspective to explore the discursive dynamics of their encounter, which represented contact between role-playing game designers from different traditions that were driven by similar imperatives and goals. It establishes the context of their encounter, summarizes the video recordings that document it, and uses the “dramatistic pentad” developed by rhetorician Kenneth Burke as a tool for reading the multiple levels of narrative and interaction that emerge as each speaker presents their perspective on the development of the different communities of play for whom they speak. It identifies an important dynamic within their speech as being how orientations toward differentiation or toward integration manifest in different ways. Ultimately, the encounter between Ron Edwards and Tobias Wrigstad provides access to different ways of thinking about the relationships between role-playing communities over time and in space: as instances of differentiation or as parts of a larger dialogue.",

		"abstract": "Individuals interact with one another and develop themselves in accordance with these interactions. One group within this complex system is live action role-players (larpers). Larps are a variant of play that combine the “role-playing” of games, such as Dungeons & Dragons, with the “live action” aspects of sports. Using symbolic interactionism as its paradigmatic orientation, this study examines how the magic circle is reinforced and challenged through the development of ingame characters and their effect on the out-of-game self. The respondents of this ethnography participate in a larp called Dagorhir (1977-), which puts an emphasis on live action combat rather than role-play. Participants are part of the Las Vegas realm of Dagorhir, Barad’Dun. Players view Dagorhir as a full contact sport mixed with martial arts; role-playing and character development is encouraged, but not necessary. I observed, interviewed, and participated with this group over the period of six months. Even in a combat-oriented larp like Dagorhir, players get to choose names, weapons, clothing, fighting techniques, and other ways to develop their in-game characters; this ability establishes a connection between leisure larps and edu-larps.",

Using the concepts of spillover, bleed, compensation, role conflict, and contrast, this article focuses on how such experiences can contain reversals of playful and serious motivational states. Data was obtained by interviewing nine participants from various countries: areas of subject expertise; amounts of teaching and larping experience; and levels of education (primary, secondary, tertiary, and vocational). Qualitative content analysis (Mayring 2002) was used to evaluate the guideline-structured interviews via a category system developed from a theoretical framework, combining the research findings of Fenstermacher et al. (2009), Apter (2008), Banner (1985), Biddle (1983 and 1979), Staines (1980) and Kando and Summers (1971). The results of this investigation show that all interviewees drew on their professional teaching experiences for planning and conducting play-pretend lessons at College of Wizardry. Despite the fictionality of the setting, interviewees identified several parallels, such as approaches to teaching and an awareness for student/player needs. Playing a professor at College of Wizardry with a professional background in teaching provided an opportunity to explore and experiment, due to the absence of expectations present in professional settings. Educators larping their role enjoyed more liberty, yet also encountered familiar real-world stress factors.",

		"abstract": "This essay is a history of Dungeons & Dragons (1974-) fans in the 1970s Alarums & Excursions fanzine community. It offers a historical analysis centered around the way these fans performed hegemonic masculinity through the rules they constructed for two character classes: the damsel and the courtesan. An analysis of these two classes shows a community eager to use game rule algorithms as a way to center sexuality in their play. We argue that these communities provide evidence of how the Dungeons & Dragons ruleset provided a boiler-plate for game rules that support the norms of hegemonic masculinity and have influenced the culture of toxic masculinity in game algorithms today.",

		"abstract": "This study explored the lived experiences of young adults who play tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs) to gain deeper insights into the perceived social impact of tabletop role-playing games. Six young adults (3 men, 3 women) between the ages of 19 and 24 (M = 21.2, SD = 2.6) were recruited from role-playing communities within Nova Scotia, Canada. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to assess perceived social competence and semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect detailed qualitative data about lived experiences with role-playing games. Responses on the SDQ indicated that participants had typical strengths and difficulties with respect to social competence at the time of the current study. The qualitative description indicated the emergence of four main themes related to role-playing games from the interviews: Content Focus, Social Focus, Creativity Focus, and Identity Focus. The themes present in the interviews are consistent with findings from previous case study research, suggesting that role-playing games may have the potential to improve perceived social competence, and further elucidate the lived experiences of people who play role-playing games in terms of why they engage with tabletop role-playing games.",

		"abstract": "This paper examines the nature of conversations that occur at gaming tables in tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs) and the degree to which gendered communication impacts how individuals participate in gaming sessions. There is a host of research discussing barriers for women and minorities in terms of full representation and interaction in gaming and “geek” spaces (Garcia 2017; Reagle 2015; Stang and Trammell 2019). I assert that one rationale for this limitation is the domination of gaming spaces by men, particularly middle-class White men, and the subculture that comes along with this demographic. Dunning (1986) discusses the concept of male preserves, how sports in particular create subcultures that prize behavior and language that are associated with men and embodied in the male form. I discuss how the TRPG table is a male preserve, encouraging a level of dominance that colors table talk and acceptable norms (Dunning, Murphy and Williams 2014). The masculine nature of the discussion style of this table talk is more difficult by subaltern groups because of the clear association with “stereotypical” gamers, commonly White and male, and this difficulty is demonstrated in various ways (Bowman 2013; Hendricks 2006; Ilieva 2013). I surmise that while diversity has always existed and proceeds to improve in tabletop gaming, the subcultural elements of a male preserve remain difficult to uproot.",

La question de la méthodologie est certainement l’un des plus important enjeux des études critiques sur les jeux vidéo. Nous sommes souvent tentés d’étudier les jeux vidéo comme des objets à part entière, sans tenir compte de leur ancrage dans des jeux plus conventionnels. C’est pour cela que nous voulons faire une comparaison entre les jeux de rôle classiques et un jeu de rôle vidéo (Fallout 2, Interplay 1998). Ce mémoire veut montrer en quoi le jeu de rôle est une forme de jeu différente de tous les autres. Nous voulons donner au lecteur une vue des potentialités de ce type d’activité collaborative pour d'éventuelles études théoriques et critiques, en mettant notamment l’accent sur l’étude de ce concept mal défini qu'est l’interactivité.\nLe principal objectif de cette recherche est donc de présenter différents points de vue pouvant présider à une définition du concept d’interactivité. Ce mémoire se divise aussi en trois parties. La première présente le jeu de rôle classique et montre en quoi ce jeu peut être considéré comme un modèle d’étude pour la notion d’interactivité. La deuxième consiste en une étude du jeu vidéo Fallout 2. La troisième partie se développe autour d’une critique de la notion même d’interactivité et montre en quoi Fallout 2 peut être considéré comme un jeu interactif.",

		"abstract": "This essay explores the notion of role-playing as a form of “emergent authorship,” a bottom-up, procedural process leading to co-created, unexpected narrative outcomes. The essay begins with an overview of role-playing practices in the context of what might be termed the “participatory turn” in performance and culture, providing examples tabletop and live action role-playing games. Goffman’s concept of “engrossment” (from his writings on games) is compared to Csikszentmihalyi’s notion of “flow” as applied to role-playing and emergent authorship. The relationship of character to role-play is also explored through Schechners “not me, not not me” paradox, in which a character is seen as a hybrid between the performer and the fictional entity. Finally, drawing on Goffman and Fine, I outline a series of sociological “frames” that describe the functions within role-playing, and conclude with further discussion of role-playing as it fits into the larger participatory turn in performance and culture.",

Howard), puis d'aborder plus en détail un auteur dont les multiples adaptations ludiques sont jugées problématiques à bien des égards (style, idéologie, construction du récit, rôle des personnages) : H.P. Lovecraft. A travers ces études de cas apparaîtront les contraintes du passage d'une forme de fiction à une autre et les risques de \"trahison\" de l'oeuvre que chaque contrainte révèle. En devenant joueur, le lecteur change de vecteur et de posture d'immersion : de la confrontation individuelle à une fiction finie à l'engagement collectif dans un univers incomplet, de la collaboration interprétative autour d'un texte au partage des tâches créatives autour d'une table de jeu, du suivi contemplatif - et non passif - d'un récit à l'expérience d'une quête interactive et modulaire, d'une approche mimétique de l'univers fictionnel à sa mathématisation partielle (système de simulation). Ce panorama restera centré sur les jeux de rôle sur table (coeur de mon dernier ouvrage publié), mais pourra être élargi lors de la discussion à d'autres systèmes de simulation (jeu vidéo, jeux de société traditionnels) où se pose également la question des ponts avec la littérature.",

We present a fresh perspective on interactive digital storytelling systems based on table-top role playing games. Table-top games offer players the ability to negotiate and determine outcomes of a game with a referee. The nature of table-top gaming is such that players evolve, grow and maintain a rule set that represents an imaginary world. As such this form of gameplay provides a unique opportunity to study complex interactive storytelling structures under controlled circumstances. Using table-top role playing games as a model, we propose terminology and concepts that are different from the traditional literary or dramaturgical perspectives normally applied to interactive narrative systems.",

		"abstract": "Cette recherche traite du jeu de rôle sur table comme moyen oral et collectif de création fictionnelle et littéraire. Elle montre que les JdR mettent en place des dispositifs ludiques qui obligent les joueurs à co-générer un contenu fictionnel diégétique et narratif, selon le principe qui est nommé l’intercréativité. L’intercréativité propre aux JdR fusionne les actes de création et de réception de la fiction et met en crise le rapport de la littérature à l’écrit. Dans un premier temps, nous étudions la manière dont s’est élaboré le concept d’intercréativité tout au long de l’histoire des JdR. Ensuite, nous les intégrons à un ensemble dont ils sont un élément fondateur, la culture geek. Nous montrons que le JdR est un héritier des littératures de l’imaginaire et qu’il fait la jonction entre ces deux sphères. Les JdR y sont également envisagés comme des mondes fictionnels intercréés, précurseurs d’une part des univers partagés et des jeux vidéo RPG, et d’autre part de la systématisation des mondes fictionnels qui induisent une réception interactive. Dans notre troisième partie, nous expliquons en quoi l’intercréativité fictionnelle mise en place par le JdR est un processus narratif et littéraire, une expérience collective et immédiate de la création de la fiction par le langage oral. Nous nous penchons sur les spécificités narratives de ce médium. Nous montrons également comment ces outils de création fictionnelle dépassent, pour certains écrivains, le cadre des JdR pour déboucher sur une création littéraire classique. Enfin, nous abordons le ludique comme un ensemble de dispositifs qui obligent les joueuses à créer un contenu fictionnel ensemble, ce que nous nommons l’intercréativité. Le JdR accomplit une disruption et une systématisation du matériau fictionnel, dont la réorganisation narrative est la création des joueurs. Avec l’intercréativité, c’est un rapport dionysiaque à la littérature qui ressurgit, alors qu’il avait été annihilé par l’industrialisation.

		"abstract": "Miller (1984) notes that when a communicative action is repeated and acquires a name within a community, it is probably functioning as a genre. In conjunction with the creation of Dungeons and Dragons (D & D) in 1974, the term 'role-playing game' has been used by gamers to specify a particular type of game that involves face-to-face interaction between a gamemaster and players with the intention of creating a narrative. Theorists of games often acknowledge D & D as a foundational text, but do not consider it a separate genre from games that involve the control of an avatar in a computer-mediated environment. However, that tabletop RPGs have not been replaced by computer games and that gaming communities continue to refer to them by separate terms suggests that there are generic differences at work. The purpose of this thesis is to begin a more detailed study of the RPG genre by examining specific examples from a D & D adventure. I build on the work of Fine and Mackay but offer perspectives from narrative, game, and rhetorical theory. While my own study must be limited in scope, I suggest a possible framework for future study of RPGs as a rhetorical genre. To establish this framework, I use Ryan's (2001) study of narrative as virtual reality to explain how RPGs are examples of texts that involve productive interactivity. In Ryan's terms, they combine elements of immersion and interactivity, and of narrative and game. I propose viewing RPGs as a system of frames based on Ryan's (1991) possible-worlds terminology and Cook-Gumperz's (1992) account of forms of talk in make-believe games. I define these frames in terms of their reference to a social sphere, a game sphere, and a narrative sphere. To explain the structure of the plot in RPGs, I compare them to Ryan's (2001) tree-diagram format for interactive texts and Aarseth's (1997) cybertext model. I conclude that none of these formats fits the RPG completely, and that it should be viewed as its own genre. Because.",

		"abstract": "The introduction of interactivity to popular narratives has changed the relationships of authors and readers to those works, as well as the relations between the authors and readers themselves. In fact, the nature itself of those new texts is being put to question as they are no longer set but open; no longer the result of single minds, but that of a collaborative effort between conceptors and interactors.\nIn this context, recreational role-playing games (e.g.: Advanced Dungeons & Dragons) are seen as precursors to computerized interactive narrative media (i.e. such as computerized text-based adventure games, Muds, CD-Roms, hypertext narratives, etc.).\nAfter a review of various conceptions of interactivity, play is put forward as the most productive metaphor to start thinking about narrative interactivity. Different aspects of role-playing games (social, ludic, ideologic, etc.) are then introduced, after which their historical filiation with computerized interactive media will be presented. Finally, a discussion of the new ways in which power and pleasure are articulated around the open text will be initiated, where it will be shown how role-playing games can contribute to that reflection.",

It is a history only in a limited sense of the term. It focuses on origins, believing that what Tocqueville said of nations is also true of cultural phenomena such as games: “[T]hey all bear some marks of their origin; and the circumstances which accompanied their birth and contributed to their rise affect the whole term of their being” (Tocqueville 17). Dungeons and Dragons is primarily considered in terms of Max Weber’s discussion of the protestant ethic and the irrationality of rationality; concurrently, this article also demonstrates the utility of D&D as a means to explore any number of cultural and social questions. The productive tension between rationality and enchantment identified in D&D has broad-reaching implications for understanding other areas of culture to which Weberian ideas are more typically applied.",

The functionality of the GM across game platforms is directly related to a handful of variables.In spite of being a core concept in role playing games, the full range of tools provided to GMs have not been fully integrated across the game platforms. The introduction of GM functionality in multiplayer computer role playing games such as Vampire the Masquerade: Redemption and Neverwinter Nights, indicate a substantial potential for development of toolsets for human-controlled interactive, emergent storytelling environments in virtual worlds, at several levels of functionality. Giving control of the game world to the players encourages a dynamic form of storytelling in games which is more reactive, and tailored to the specific players, than what is currently possible using pre-programmed static narratives or automated storytelling engines.",

The malleability of this world, coupled with the RPGs' social aspect, parallels the socially constructed reality which usually surrounds us. In this paper I collect a series of impressions from a few roleplaying sessions during which different groups of players attempted to construct new realities. In this sense, I examine the shared creation of reality out of empty space, exploring the potential inherent in roleplaying as a metaphor for organizing. I look for non-standard view-points on organizing which emerge from these sessions, and examine the process itself, not trying to pinpoint any regularities, but rather seeking the unusual and the sublime.",

By taking the approach that narrative can be understood with games, but only by incorporating the dynamics of game play and by accepting that existing models of narrative must be modified, this paper examines the place of narrative within role-playing games. Narrative can be defined as a description of a series of events. The description that narrative represents is experienced by the players, in an individual and personal manner. The implications of this for familiar concepts such as story and text are examined, and definitions proposed for them in the role-playing game context. Each can be best understood as unique to each participant in the game. The result shows that existing theories can be applied to the gaming context, but only with significant modification. The definitions proposed also allow for an initial consideration of how narrative is constructed in role-playing games.",

		"abstract": "Trans-reality games are games combining virtual gaming with game experiences staged and played in physical environments. Mobile, ubiquitous and pervasive gaming technologies provide a facilitating infrastructure for trans-reality games. The technical infrastructure must integrate physical game elements with virtual game elements, ideally allowing game play and components to move as \"seamlessly\" as possible through these spaces as parts of a single coherent game world. This means the preservation of the sense of identity of game objects through their manifestation in different physical and virtual realities, the propagation of the significance of game actions and events through these realities, and game mechanics that weave those events into a coherent game concept. The development of design principles and methodologies for trans-reality games requires a model of the relationships between the functional roles of players and technologies, how these vary with different game staging and scenarios, and how these variations can be integrated within games that involve different modes of physical, virtual and mixed reality game play. In the case of trans-reality role-playing games (TRRPGs) these questions extend to issues of characterization and story construction. The concept of a TRRPG extends and evolves existing role-playing game (RPG) forms including table-top (TTRPG), live-action (LARP), computer-based, and especially massively multiplayer on-line (MMORPG), RPGs. A game system consisting of core rules and basic models for such things as characters and objects, their features and capabilities, combat, economics and trading, can often be used across all of these different contexts. However, despite this trans-mediality of the game system, the experience of characterization and narrative depth among different RPG forms is fundamentally different, largely due to radically different modes of story construction among the different forms. Previous work has analysed the relationships between simulation, game play and narrativity in computer games (see Aarseth, 1997, Frasca, 2001, and Lindley, 2003). These distinctions can be generalized into a model of the structure of all RPG forms, including table-top and live-action RPGs. The simulation level generalizes to a simulation/realization level providing a world within which game and story experiences take place. The game world may be realized with a literal representation (the game space stands for itself), synthetic or fictional representation (the world is realized symbolically), or some hybrid of literal and synthetic elements. The simulation level also includes foundations for realizing a range of possible literal or symbolic actions. This is the lowest level of temporal design in a ludic system upon which is superimposed a game level that includes rules specifying actions constituting valid game moves together with objectives for players to achieve by the performance of game moves. The time structure of each move requires a higher level of design than the simulation/realization level. However, the potential for players to choose moves results in a very loosely predefined time structure above the level of moves within the design of a game. Above the level of game moves, narrative is perceived when an experience in time has an overall shape conforming to a specific narrative pattern, such as the three-act restorative structure. This is the highest level of predefined time structure. In general a narrative is a representation of events. In computer games this often has the form of a filmic story told by cut scenes and framing the play experience (performance of moves) at a high level. Structural theories of textual and verbal narrative posit a generative substrate (a cultural space of possible stories) underlying the diegesis or specific objects and events of a particular narrative. The diegesis and its events constitute a story. The selection and presentation of elements of the story, with expressive variations of emphasis, constitute a plot. The plot is expressed in an act of telling, ie. a particular narrative. The available text is the narrative, while the other layers of meaning are inferred from the text and its relationship with other texts. Considering narrative construction and encoding within RPGs reveals very different relationships to this model. A TTRPG may be based upon published game worlds, scenarios and systems including elements of classic textual narrative. This provides the foundation for a game master and group of players to improvise a new (primarily verbal) narrative through the unfolding play sessions of a TTRPG campaign. Improvisation involves assembling sequences of fictive blocks, basic fragments or units of fictional/narrative significance that may be strung together to form a higher level narrative (Mackay, 2001). The fictive blocks include moves and text provided by the game system together with those drawn from the players’ imaginations and experiences. A computer-based MMORPG, however, provides players with a finite and fixed set of possible moves, together with the media foundation for realising moves as audiovisual and simulation events. Hence the MMORPG player generally chooses from predefined fictive blocks, supplemented by textual interaction with other players via chat facilities. This is a severely constrained improvisational freedom compared with the other RPG forms; the computer RPG removes much of the space for individual interpretation and imaginative elaboration by providing very explicit visualisations together with very limited options for improvisation. Collaborative story formation in LARPs is different again. While a TTRPG collaboratively produces a collective text upon which individual acts of imagination build, a LARP consists of a kind of performative multitext; there is no central social representation (or narrative), and there is a different story for each player, none occupying a privileged position as keeper of a primary story. The LARP setting may vary in its diegetic freedom between that of a MMORPG and that of a TTRPG, depending upon the literalness of representation of its setting, costumes, props and performances. LARP performances have the full advantage of all avenues of direct, face-to-face human communication, leading to the possibility of the highest levels of immersive and emotional experience. A trans-reality RPG (TRRPG) must integrate the different narrative modalities of RPG forms into a coherent overall system. This requires a careful mapping of player roles and technical mechanisms onto narrative functions in ways that preserve or enhance the strengths of the different play modalities involved, and ideally feed the results of play from their strong modalities into the other modes to enrich the overall TRRPG experience.",

		"abstract": "Typical definitions of games and gameplay discount the most integral part of the role-playing game: that fact that it is a game, and that gameplay is very much involved in the process of propelling the narrative forward. It also ignores the principal appeal of role-playing games; that is, the emulation of social drama through fictional situations, or the manifestation of the fundamental human inclination towards play. It can be said, therefore that participants in an RPG cannot simply be regarded as players, nor can they be viewed as passive consumers of a narrative through their control of a character, they are gamers, readers and storytelling agents all in one. Because they role-play, these individuals are immersed in the imaginary world of the RPG, becoming the characters that they control, performing the roles that have been assigned to them (or, in some cases, roles that the player decided to take for himself or herself) in a simulation that is less like writing out a part of a narrative and more like the acting out of a role in a dramatic text on stage. As such, it may be possible to say that the element of role-play in RPGs makes them, in a sense, theatrical. Exploring the commonalities between role-playing games and the act of role-play with theatre and stage performance presents one with the possibility of gaining a new perspective on both forms while taking their unique characteristics into account.",

		"abstract": "This paper deals with cartographic representations as means of communicating the imaginary using maps in fantasy role-playing games as an example. Drawing on SCHUTZian accounts of intersubjectivity and communication we understand maps as one of many strategies to deal with the problem of \"medium transcendencies\" posed by communicating with others. The methodology of \"sociological hermeneutics\" (SOEFFNER) is introduced as means of approaching maps and the interactions they are involved in. In our analyses of maps used in role-playing games we can then show that maps are not only a means of locating oneself but also a means of actively creating a meaningful place in which we are entangled. Thus, maps help to form a sense of belonging in (imaginary) territories which are only given to us in mediated form.",

Details of print, print-on-demand, free and purchasable downloads, and subscription-based options for major fantasy role-playing games and alternatives are provided.\nFindings – Many options are available to libraries wishing to provide support for fantasy role-playing game programming. While an overwhelming quantity of publications are often available for purchase, usually only a bare minimum is required to run a role-playing game. Free or modestly priced options are available for libraries on a shoestring budget. Libraries interested in supporting fantasy role-playing game programming with collections need not spend much. Spending less on collections requires a greater amount of imagination, socializing, creativity, collaboration and literacy on the part of program participants.\nOriginality/value – Many libraries are interested in supporting fantasy role-playing games with collections, but do not know where to start. While much is being written about gaming in libraries, little has been written to help libraries navigate current role-playing game book publication and sales models.",

		"abstract": "This volume will convince readers that the swift ascent of the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons to worldwide popularity in the 1970s and 1980s is \"the most exciting event in popular culture since the invention of the motion picture.\" Dungeons and Dragons and Philosophy presents twenty-one chapters by different writers, all D&D aficionados but with starkly different insights and points of view.  It will be appreciated by thoughtful fans of the game, including both those in their thirties, forties, and fifties who have rediscovered the pastime they loved as teenagers and the new teenage and college-student D&D players who have grown up with gaming via computer and console games and are now turning to D&D as a richer, fuller gaming experience. The book is divided into three parts. The first, \"Heroic Tier: The Ethical Dungeon-Crawler,\" explores what D&D has to teach us about ethics and about how results from the philosophical study of morality can enrich and transform the game itself. Authors argue that it's okay to play evil characters, criticize the traditional and new systems of moral alignment, and (from the perspective of those who love the game) tackle head-on the recurring worries about whether the game has problems with gender and racial stereotypes. Readers of Dungeons and Dragons and Philosophy will become better players, better thinkers, better dungeon-masters, and better people. Part II, \"Paragon Tier: Planes of Existence,\" arouses a new sense of wonder about both the real world and the collaborative world game players create. Authors look at such metaphysical questions as what separates magic from science, how we express the inexpressible through collaborative storytelling, and what the objects that populate Dungeons and Dragons worlds can teach us about the equally fantastic objects that surround us in the real world. The third part, \"Epic Tier: Leveling Up,\" is at the crossroads of philosophy and the exciting new field of Game Studies. The writers investigate what makes a game a game, whether D&D players are artists producing works of art, whether D&D (as one of its inventors claimed) could operate entirely without rules, how we can overcome the philosophical divide between game and story, and what types of minds take part in D&D.",

Minoritaires dans les usages, rarement fixées sous la forme d'œuvres, économiquement insignifiantes, les pratiques narratives de face-à-face (jeux de rôle sur table et grandeur nature, « storygames ») demeurent souvent cantonnées aux notes de bas de page et aux rappels historiques qui cadrent la discussion sans l'alimenter. J'entends rappeler l'intérêt que revêt une analyse plus équilibrée de l'interactivité, et notamment souligner l'inventivité des auteurs « papier-crayon », à l'heure où les techniques de scénarisation en jeu vidéo peinent à se renouveler. L'exemple de quelques storygames montrera comment l'improvisation collective en langue naturelle peut enrichir le regard des narratologues sur l'interactivité. L'idée n'est pas de « jouer » l'analogique « contre » le numérique, mais de bâtir un modèle unifié autour de leurs points communs : les notions d'environnement et d'intrigue.",

		"abstract": "This chapter compares the experience of gaming and the experience of reading, and explores what that comparison might tell us about each. More specifically, it applies methods of literary analysis to the study of two narrative activities situated near the border of reading and gaming: Electronic hyperfictions and role-playing games. Miller first reviews literary theories of reader response and interactivity and notes how these have informed recent critical discussions of literary hyperfiction. He then critiques these discussions and the claims made for hyperfiction's liberating or empowering effect on readers: Contrary to the claims of some critics, such narratives generally fail to fulfill these promises and are, in fact, in many ways less interactive than traditional print fictions. The author then approaches the border between gaming and reading from the other direction, by examining a form of gaming that resembles reading in interesting ways: Role-playing games. Miller explores how reader response theories apply to analyzing the effects and meanings of such games, concluding that role-playing games provide a better model for the reification of reader response theories, albeit in a medium which is more oral than written, than do the hyperfictions which have received more serious attention from literary theorists. As such, role-playing games offer a potential medium for more truly interactive fiction that \"serious\" authors have yet to explore. Raising questions of textuality and its relation to games, Miller argues for the inclusion of games in contemporary literary studies and shows how fruitful such studies may be for our understanding of \"new media\" possibilities.",

		"abstract": "The Interactive Dilemma is the inevitable conflict between author’s determinism and interactor’s freedom. There are some approaches that try to tackle it, using strategies and heuristic rules that can combine on the fly the previously designed author material with the run-time decisions of the interactor. Interactive Narrative is a relatively new field and it is difficult to find formal studies that shows how to create this kind of art. Our proposal is based on the theoretical study of tabletop Role-Playing Games and it involves the practical implementation of those ideas for managing the interaction in a simple text adventure game. Game Masters are the best models we have found in real life for designing and directing interactive stories. In this paper we transfer their player modeling, their rules for interaction management and their improvising algorithms from the real world to a new Interactive Storytelling system.",

Medievalism examines how different groups, individuals, or eras use and shape the image of the Middle Ages, differentiating between historical knowledge of the Middle Ages and what we have made the period out to be. The 13 essays in this book explore the medieval invasion of today's media and consider the various ways--from film and print to websites and video games--that the Middle Ages have been packaged for consumption. Essays encompass diverse theoretical perspectives and are grouped loosely around distinct functions of medievalism, including the exposure of recent social concerns; the use of medieval images in modern political contexts; and the medieval's influence on products of today's popular culture. The legitimization of the study of medievalism and the effect of medievalism on the more traditional subject of medieval studies are also discussed.",

		"abstract": "Role Playing Games (RPGs) is a popular game form. RPGs have been translated into all media formats, and are also a rare example of functioning interactive narratives. Despite the popularity of these games, especially within computer games, and the possibility that experiences from RPGs could be used in designing interactive storytelling systems for next generation interactive entertainment systems, there have been very few academic studies focused on cross-platform studies of role playing games. In this paper, the results of a comparative analysis of pen and paper RPGs and computer RPGs, using an information systems perspective coupled with games analysis, is presented. The differences of the two game forms revolve around the different media formats and the limitations these impose and the options they provide. The formation of the collaborative story is a core feature of these games. While the formation of the storyline in multiplayer RPGs are complex, it appears that information systems modeling of multiplayer RPG story and control processes enables quantifiable modeling of an interactive storytelling systems.",

		"abstract": "Scholars who study learning in video games draw direct parallels to tabletop role-playing games (RPGs) like Dungeons & Dragons in terms of the underlying principles that enhance learning. In fact, tabletop RPGs have formed the statistical, and sometimes creative, basis for many of the most popular role-playing video games to date, so why is it that tabletop RPGs have been largely neglected in favor of the video game variety? This study takes a close look at how one particular group of players of Dungeons & Dragons engages the game as both a game and as an act of narrative creation. Their interactions can reveal something about how storytelling has changed in response to changes in technology and how this contributes to learning within various domains. In conducting this study, the author observed the group play and also became a participant in the experience to better understand how this group functions. Observation and interaction with these players show that they create stories that are not confined by the traditional boundaries of narrative, such as having a beginning, middle, and end. These stories are not confined to a single method of communication; the group takes advantage of music, films, objects, and even an online forum to expand their narratives across multiple media. The members of this group collectively and actively write their stories, all the while remaining aware that they are in fact creating a story. They challenge each other to improve and collectively work to become better, smarter role-players and narrative writers.",

The model is tested in practice and its applicability across tabletop, digital and other forms and formats is demonstrated. Special emphasis is placed on multi-player and massively multi-player games, as well as role playing games, as these feature complex game time behavior that cannot be explored in existing models of game time. The model includes seven viewpoints of game time, and allows for the mapping of time as an interactively created and non-linear feature of games and gameplay.",

Despite their popularity, empirical studies of these games are relatively rare. In particular there have been few examinations of the effects of the various formats used by RPGs on the gaming experience. This article presents the results of an empirical study, examining how multi-player tabletop RPGs are affected as they are ported to the digital medium. Issues examined include the use of disposition assessments to predict play experience, the effect of group dynamics, the influence of the fictional game characters and the comparative play experience between the two formats. The results indicate that group dynamics and the relationship between the players and their digital characters, are integral to the quality of the gaming experience in multiplayer RPGs, with the first being of greater importance to digital games and the latter to the tabletop version.",

		"abstract": "This thesis addresses how the commonalities of \"Dungeons and Dragons\" and Episodic television are used as a framework for character development for writers and players. Through the Dramatistic Pentad, this study examines the texts of the Players Handbook and Dungeon Masters Guide by Gary Gygax and the episodic television texts Crafty TV Writing Thinking Inside The Box by Alex Epstein and Television Writing from the Inside Out Your Channel to Success by Larry Brody. Throughout this study, the concepts of Dungeons and Dragons and Episodic television are categorized, aligned, and analyzed to determine how these commonalities are used as a framework for character development.\nResearch on this subject reveals that the characters' scenes, actions, and purposes are a direct extension and reflection of their universe. The scenes, actions, and purposes are a way for writers, players, and an audience to understand character and story development as a whole, not from one aspect.",

		"abstract": "Le terme jeu de rôle est souvent mal interprété et méconnu. En effet, il est confondu avec toute sorte d'activités qui ne le concerne que peu, comme les jeux de rôles en entreprise, les thérapies psychologiques, etc. Ici, nous allons étudier le jeu de rôle sous sa forme première, en tant qu'activité créative dont beaucoup de caractéristiques peuvent se rapporter à des domaines littéraires, comme la narratologie. Pourtant, il n'existe en France que peu d'études littéraires sur le sujet, c'est pourquoi nous avons décidé d'y consacrer ce mémoire.  \nNous avons porté notre choix de corpus sur trois œuvres:  \n  - INS / MV: ce jeu français met en scène des anges et des démons qui vivent dans notre monde réel et contemporain. Ils se livrent une guerre ancestrale et secrète pour obtenir l'âme des êtres humains qui ne se doutent de rien. On peut jouer des anges ou des démons. \n  - Shadowrun: ce jeu américain prend place dans un univers cyberpunk, dans une réalité alternative dystopique. La magie est apparue après les années 2000, introduisant des éléments d'heroic fantasy. Le monde est contrôlé par des multinationales tentaculaires qui rivalisent pour acquérir de plus en plus de pouvoir. On y joue des mercenaires à la solde de ces \"méga-corporations\".  \n  - Vampire: le Requiem: l'univers décrit par ce jeu américain est le même que le nôtre, à ceci près que certaines créatures surnaturelles (loups-garous, fantômes) existent et évoluent dans l'ombre. Ici on joue des vampires, êtres nocturnes torturées par leur condition.  \nNous allons donc nous consacrer à la découverte du jeu de rôle en passant essentiellement par des exemples tirés de ce corpus, sachant que nous aurons également recours à d'autres jeux plus épisodiquement. Il s'agit bien ici d'une découverte, puisque peu de gens sont capables de définir le jeu de rôle selon des critères littéraires. Nous nous attacherons alors à répondre à la question suivante: en quoi le jeu de rôle est une nouvelle forme littéraire qui créé et régit ses propres caractéristiques et codes ? \nD'abord, nous allons essayer de définir le jeu de rôle et de présenter les différentes écoles de pensées qui l'ont théorisé afin d'arriver à notre propre définition. Ensuite, nous tenterons de démontrer que les univers rôlistiques sont proches des mondes paralittéraires, genre auquel appartient sûrement le jeu de rôle. Enfin, nous étudierons les différentes techniques littéraires employées dans les jeux de rôles et les buts qu'elles s'efforcent d'atteindre.",

This article argues that Dungeons & Dragons introduces us to a world composed of objects or entities, where the being of objects is defined not by their qualities, but rather by their powers, capacities or affects. Drawing on the thought of Spinoza, Deleuze and Molnar, objects are seen to be defined by what they can do or their capacities to act, such that qualities are effects of these acts. Dungeons & Dragons is particularly suited to showing us this insofar as it focuses on the action of entities.",

		"abstract": "Forming one of the major genres of games, Role Playing Games (RPGs) have proven an extremely portable concept, and the games are situated across various cultural and format-related boundaries. The effect of porting RPGs between formats is however a subject of which very little is known. This paper presents results of an empirical study of multi-player RPGs, evaluating how the transference between formats affects the player experience; including the effect of including a human game master in computer-based RPGs. The tabletop format emerges as the consistently most enjoyable experience across a range of formats, even compared to a computer-based RPG directed by a human game master.",

The 21st century Lovecraft storyworld is elicited by textual fiction, interactive fiction, short and feature-length films, fan art, comics, music, board games, role-playing games, computer games and interactive environments online, to name just a few examples. This transmedial foundation, which continues to grow, prompts several questions. What allure does the storyworld hold for both audiences and producers? How do works engage with its core elements in familiar yet media-specific ways? How has this developing storyworld contributed to 'pulp' writer Lovecraft’s apparent elevation into the American literary canon? In this essay I explore the poetics of the Lovecraft storyworld’s development, its transmedial adaptability and its cultural significance for both contemporary audiences and Lovecraft's legacy.",

Students studied the narrative unit operations (Bogost 2006) present in short fiction, films, and the videogame\nFallout 3\n before collaboratively creating an immersive fictional world by populating a wiki with items, locations, and characters. Students explored their newly created world through tabletop role-playing campaigns and wrote vignette-length stories from their characters’ perspectives. Students strongly preferred this approach to the traditional workshop method commonly used in creative writing classes, citing stronger understanding of character and motivations as well as the significant benefits derived from collaborative writing. Role-playing also fostered a strong and supportive community for student writers. Despite institutional challenges, role-playing games offer a compelling way to improve current fiction writing pedagogical practices and encourage new modes of collaborative writing.",

		"abstract": "Recent decades have produced millions of medieval re-enactors, role players, and fantasy buffs -- and billions of dollars for the industries that fuel them. However, writes Gravois, academic medievalists have viewed this engorged popular interest not as an embarrassment of riches, but as simply embarrassment. Yet those same re-enactors, role players, and fantasy buffs make some of the most natural candidates for academic study of the Middle Ages. Surely, thought Gravois, the two worlds must be mixing, as generations of gamers and fantasy buffs have matured into scholars. Gravois shares his thought from the International Congress on Medieval Studies at Western Michigan University, the world's premier annual gathering of scholars who study the middle ages, where one attendant asked \"When you say 'fantasy,'\" she said, \"you think 'medieval.' So: Why?\" The simplest answer to that question, says Gravois, is John Ronald Reuel Tolkien. Dungeons & Dragons, World of Warcraft, EverQuest: all of them derive from Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth, a world built from medieval languages, references, and literary conventions. Some scholars say Renaissance Faires and the Society for Creative Anachronism got their momentum from Tolkien's surge in popularity in the 1960s. At the same time, Tolkien is an immensely important figure in medieval studies. Modern medievalists credit him with being the first scholar to treat Beowulf and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight as texts with literary depth, instead of just as linguistic time capsules. It is thanks to him, many believe, that those poems have become canonical works rather than obscurities. Daniel T. Kline, a professor of medieval and Renaissance English at the University of Alaska at Anchorage offers another insight that far predates Tolkien. Kline, along with other scholars of the middle ages, has begun thinking about fantasy literature and role-playing games as actual revivals of medieval literary forms. Arthurian legends, he and others say, had a similar open-ended narrative structure, a similar relationship to an ahistorical imagined past and a similar kind of open authorship. Unlike more modern forms, the medieval approach to storytelling is one that lends itself perfectly to fantasy worlds that can be endlessly constructed, reconstructed, and traversed.",

		"abstract": "Das Gestalten fiktiver Welten ist ein Leitmotiv des Phantastischen. Mit dem \"clash of realities\" als gattungsdefinitorischem Merkmal nimmt die spezifische Weise, in der diese Bereiche inszeniert werden, und deren qualitative Bestimmung einen bedeutenden Raum in der Theorie des Phantastischen ein. Dieses zeigt sich darin zugleich auch als ein ästhetisches Paradigma, das nicht gattungs- oder gar mediengebunden ist, sondern seine spezifische Ausprägung in Abhängigkeit von dem Kontext erhält, innerhalb dessen es in Erscheinung tritt. Im Fall des phantastischen Rollenspiels wird das Überschreiten der Grenze zu diesen andren Welten zum Leitmotiv – als Raum, der nicht im Sinne z.B. einer ausgeschriebenen Text- oder Filmwelt fixiert ist, ermöglicht dieses Medium wie kein anderes die Entgrenzung der phantastischen Welt, die es in sich entwirft. Die dergestalt \"grenzenlos\" werdende Phantastik, der grenzenlos werdende PhantasieRaum bedingt einerseits ein schier unüberschaubares Ausmaß an Erscheinungsformen, andererseits aber auch die Problematik des Flüchtigen, Nicht-Fassbaren, das zwischen Spielwelt und physischer Realität changiert. Im Folgenden soll es um die Bestimmung dieses spezifischen Phantasie-Raumes gehen. Mit Blick auf die strukturellen Bedingungen des Mediums Rollenspiel wie seines Themas, des Phantastischen, stellen sich im Wesentlichen zwei Fragen. Erstens: Auf welche Weise eröffnet das Medium Rollenspiel seinen Raum? Und zweitens: Um was für einen Raum handelt es sich dabei?",

The avatar as an agent of the\nplayer is in the focus of that process. It constitutes the main function of immersive\nexperiences, both structural and as in regards to content, which are comparable\nto written fiction. Immersion in Role-playing means transcending physical reality\ninto an imaginary space, whose contents the players create and interact with. As a\nmedium that solely focusses on establishing inner immersive visual experiences, it\nshould systematically be included in future research",

		"abstract": "Das Spielen zählt zu den ältesten Kulturphänomenen der Menschheit, gleiches gilt für das Erzählen. Eine ebenso ungewöhnliche wie innovative Verbindung von Spielen und Erzählen bietet das Fantasy-Rollenspiel, eine Freizeitbeschäftigung, in der sowohl simulative als auch narrative Elemente einen zentralen Platz einnehmen. Diese Studie bietet eine umfassende Darstellung von Geschichte, Gestalt und Praxis des Fantasy-Rollenspiels. Mit Hilfe interdisziplinärer literatur- und spieltheoretischer Methoden wird der Frage nachgegangen, inwiefern sich die unterschiedlichen Aspekte des Rollenspiels voneinander abgrenzen bzw. als Einzelelemente beschreiben lassen. Geboten wird ein Überblick über die Entstehung und Fortentwicklung einer neuen literarischen Gattung im Spannungsfeld zwischen Spielen und Erzählen. Eine Betrachtung unter erzähltheoretischen Gesichtspunkten zeigt, dass Rollenspiele nicht allein Spiele sind, sondern auch ein erzählerisches Potential von hohem Stellenwert besitzen. Von besonderem Interesse ist zudem die Verbindung von Simulation und Narration, die in dieser Form bei keiner anderen literarischen Gattung zu finden ist. Eine vergleichende Untersuchung mehrerer verbreiteter Rollenspiel-Systeme erlaubt Aufschluss über Wesen und Charakter der Gattung sowohl aus narratologischer als auch aus ludologischer Perspektive.",

		"abstract": "Often dismissed as \"not serious,\" the notion of play has nevertheless been at the centre of classical theories of religion and ritual (Huizinga, Caillois, Turner, Staal, etc.). What can be retained of those theories for the contemporary study of religions? Can a study of \"play\" or \"game\" bring new perspectives for the study of religions? The book deals with the history of games and their relation to religions, the links between divination and games, the relations between sport and ritual, the pedagogical functions of games in religious education, and the interaction between games, media and religions. Richly illustrated, the book contributes to the study of religions, to ritual, game and media studies, and addresses an academic as well as a general public. Philippe Bornet, Dr. Phil., born in 1977, is Lecturer in the Study of Religion at the Faculty of Lettres of the University of Lausanne, with focus on the history of interrelations between India and Europe. Maya Burger is Professor of Indian Studies and History of Religions at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Lausanne, Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations.",

		"abstract": "Les jeux occupent aujourd’hui une place centrale dans la palette des fictions. Si les jeux abstraits constituent un pôle autonome d’expression logico-mathématique, les jeux de simulation sont en revanche créés par association d’un thème et d’un système, ce qui les rend à la fois mimétiques et axiomatiques. On étudie ici différentes manifestations de plaisir esthétique liées à l’expérience des jeux, indépendamment de leur ornementation visuelle ou sonore. Pour les jeux abstraits, on identifie trois motifs : le sublime qui reflète notre incapacité à embrasser l’immensité d’une combinatoire, le subtil qui se révèle lors de la résolution d’énigmes originales ou difficiles, et le merveilleux qui découle de la découverte de propriétés inattendues du système. Les jeux de simulation sont étudiés en deux temps : les jeux de plateau et de rôle dont le système fonctionne comme une épure, et les jeux vidéo qui associent performance générale du moteur et création d’écarts esthétiques par le détail.",

		"abstract": "Cet article traite du jeu de rôle sur table comme moyen oral et collectif de création fictionnelle par le langage verbal, et interroge son rapport au littéraire. Il explique la manière dont les jeux de rôle mettent en place des dispositifs ludiques qui permettent, voire obligent, les joueurs à co-générer un matériau fictionnel démiurgique et narratif, selon le principe qui est nommé l’intercréativité. Ainsi, les jeux de rôle font de la réception une étape de création de la fiction. Mais peuvent-ils être considérés comme une forme de jeu littéraire oral et collectif ? Pour répondre à cette question, cet article analyse dans un premier temps le rapport qu’entretiennent littérature et jeu d’une façon générale. Ensuite, il étudie le JdR en tant que processus conversationnel, oral et « présentifié » qui génère une création fictionnelle collective. Avec l’intercréativité, c’est un rapport dionysiaque à la littérature qui ressurgit, alors qu’il avait été annihilé à l’ère moderne.",

		"abstract": "The figure of the Vampire, as we know it today, has captivated people’s\nimagination for centuries. Vampire legends can be found in Mesopotamian cultures and in\nearly Greek myths, as well as the blood-drinking spirits of Chinese and Japanese civilisations.\nThese stories were particularly relevant in the folklore of Eastern Europe, and spread from\nthere, first in the form of travelling tales in the 16th- and 17th-centuries, and then formalized\nas the gothic tales and melodramas of the romantic imagination in the late 18th and early\n19th-centuries, coinciding with the re-structuring of society and the emergence of\nindustrialization. Most scholars have argued that these stories reflected unconscious\ncommunity fears at a time of rapid social changes. The vampire is one of the emblems of the\nGothic exploration of the monstrous. It represents the inhuman and the undead. A monster\nof the night that lives at the expense of other living creatures.\nContemporary works of modern and postmodern horror maintain, in many cases,\nsimilar iconographies while incorporating some changes to the figure of the vampire. Closely\nassociated with technological advance, the vampire took on new attributes with the\nemergence of cinematography. One of the first a most famous movies in this regard is 1922\nNosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror) by the German\nexpressionist F.W. Murnau.",

En outre, le marché du jeu de rôle français est si limité dans sa taille et dans ses moyens qu’il ne peut vivre sans se nourrir de la participation des fans au développement de ses univers et sans mélanger productions professionnelles et productions faniques.

En effet, le JdR propose d’explorer des mondes fictionnels par le truchement de narrations fonctionnant sur le principe de l’expansion, principe qui peut se montrer aussi fertile que chaotique dans la mesure où, avec le temps et la pratique, il peut détruire la cohérence et la vraisemblance de ces mondes fictionnels. Toutefois, ce principe d’expansion peut être régulé de diverses manières. C’est cette dialectique entre expansion et régulation que nous nous proposons d’étudier. Pour cela, nous adopterons trois points de vue : le JdR en tant que média fonctionnant dans un système transmédiatique, le JdR en tant que gamme d’ouvrages et le JdR en tant que pratique.",

Il propose une réponse à la problématique suivante : quel sens revêt le Moyen Âge dans les jeux de rôle et comment expliquer son succès? En somme, pourquoi le Moyen Âge? Pour parvenir à résoudre cette problématique, il a été nécessaire d’effectuer une analyse visuelle et textuelle d’un corpus composé de livres de jeux de rôle et d’œuvres artistiques liées à la culture rôliste. Cette analyse a permis d’établir que le Moyen Âge est perçu comme la période de tous les possibles, une époque sans limites, entièrement malléable et modulable. L’objectif de ce travail est de sensibiliser les médiévistes aux particularités du jeu de rôle et démontrer sa valeur originale comme champ d’études légitime du médiévalisme.",

As a genre, TRPGs are characterized by multi-author collaboration and narrative agency for participants. Drawing upon the text of a pre-written scenario, as well as audio recordings from a play-through of that scenario, this essay catalogs significant points of departure between the two. This demonstrates the limits of authority between different types of authors (i.e. game designers, module writers, game masters, and players). It also reveals the points at which these roles bleed into one another, showing that professional and amateur authors are participating in much the same activity despite their apparent differences. Because TRPGs are predicated on creating texts in which amateur authors are engaged in the same work as their professional counterparts, and because texts are created with the expectation of input from lower-order authors, TRPGs represent a uniquely democratic form of convergence culture.",

		"abstract": "This essay examines the relationship between genre and franchise though a discussion of the Dragonlance series, a collection of pre-fabricated adventures for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons adapted into a series of novels. Because of the sheer number of these novels (approximately 200), the fiction set in the AD&D campaign setting known as Krynn far surpasses the scope of the original adventures in terms of narrative, character, geographical location, and historical situation. The sprawling nature of the novels, which implicitly seek to be an exhaustive account of Krynn and everything that happens there, would make Dragonlance one of the longest series in the history of generic fantasy. However, as I demonstrate, the development of the Dragonlance narrative takes place in the context of a franchise that turns away from the conventions of genre fantasy. The double origin of Dragonlance as both a setting for adventures in the AD&D game system and as a series of fantasy novels creates both the mechanistic feel of the early novels (those that were adapted directly from the pre-fabricated adventures and even from actual gaming sessions) as well as opportunities for the novels to eventually break from the conventions of generic fantasy, especially the latter’s particular concern with endings. My consideration of Dragonlance not only offers a consideration of the merely generic texts with which this special issue concerns itself, but also a means by which critics might consider franchises as objects.",

Après une rapide présentation de ces deux mondes fictionnels, il se livre dans un premier temps à l’étude des évolutions de l’imaginaire informatique constatées entre les différentes éditions de ces jeux afin de souligner deux idées importantes : la révolution que constitue un monde informatique sans fil et le paradoxe entre une démocratisation et une complexification de l’informatique. Dans un second temps, il s’efforce de dégager les grandes permanences de cet imaginaire informatique en montrant qu’il se cristallise autour des notions de capitalisme, de puissance, de violence et d’une étrange similitude entre magie et informatique., This paper aims to study how computer imaginary evolved from the end of the eighties until our days. To achieve this, we’ll scrutinize two famous cyberpunk pen and paper role playing game’s fictional worlds : Cyberpunk and Shadowrun. After a short description of those fictional worlds, we’ll study how computer imaginary evolved through the many editions of those RPG to emphasize two main ideas : the revolution of wireless hardware and the paradoxical democratization and complexity of computers. After which, we’ll show the permanence and consistency of some notions and representations : how computers are linked to capitalism and the idea of power or violence, and how computers are often related to the idea of magic.",

		"abstract": "In the old role-play game of Dungeons and Dragons, one rolls the dice to determine the character traits of one’s game avatar. One of the character trait rolls determines whether the avatar is Lawful (in the sense of rule-bound, consistent, and predictable) or Chaotic (in the sense of unruly, unpredictable, or inconsistent). A separate roll determines whether the avatar is Good, Evil, or Neutral. Thus, in the game, characters not only can be “lawful and good,” or “chaotic and evil,” but also “lawful and evil” or “chaotic and good.” From the usual jurisprudential standpoint, both the “lawful evil” and the “chaotic good” seem oxymoronic. We usually think that consistency and goodness go together. As Lon Fuller put it, “I shall have to rest on the assertion of a belief that may seem naïve, namely, that coherence and goodness have more affinity than coherence and evil.” From Kant’s universal principles of reason, to John Rawls’ operationalizing of Kant in his theory of the “original position,” which “generalizes and carries to a higher level of abstraction the familiar theory of the social contract,” to Ronald Dworkin’s “law as integrity” thesis that prefers the coherent interpretation to the incoherent - main-line legal theorists agree that good government ought to be coherent (lawful) and should not make ungeneralizable, un-rule-bound (chaotic) exceptions. In short, lawfulness is at least an aspect of good; unruliness is at least an aspect of evil. Political theorists have made similar points. Hannah Arendt and Lon Fuller point to Nazi Germany’s lawless use of retroactive legislation and its chaotic, opaque, and unpredictable lines of authority as essential means by which Hitler fostered fear and maintained personal control. On the other hand, the Dungeons and Dragons categories suggest that the association of lawfulness with goodness is not a logical necessity. Dolores Umbridge, Darth Vader, General Zod, and the Mayor of Pleasantville are among the classic “lawful evil” characters; Hans Solo, Captain Kirk, Robin Hood, and Mary Poppins are among the classic “chaotic good” characters.",

		"abstract": "In 15 all-new essays, this volume explores how science fiction and fantasy draw on materials from ancient Greece and Rome, 'displacing' them from their original settings-in time and space, in points of origins and genre-and encouraging readers to consider similar 'displacements' in the modern world. Modern examples from a wide range of media and genres-including Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials and the novels of Helen Oyeyemi, the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away, and the role-playing games Dungeons and Dragons and Warhammer 40K-are brought alongside episodes from ancient myth, important moments from history, and more. \n\nAll together, these multifaceted studies add to our understanding of how science fiction and fantasy form important areas of classical reception, not only transmitting but also transmuting images of antiquity. The volume concludes with an inspiring personal reflection from the New York Times-bestselling author of speculative fiction, Catherynne M. Valente, offering her perspective on the limitless potential of the classical world to resonate with experience today.",

Nous analyserons les jeux comme des plans d'architectes orientant la construction même des oeuvres.    Dans la continuité du master, ceci sera divisé en deux volets d'environ 200 pages chacun : l'un théorique, l'autre créatif, ce dernier étant un roman que j'appelle \"Hauteurs Contemporaines\".     Ce roman raconte l'histoire d'une dramaturge mourante qui organise une partie d'échecs en grandeur nature dans son hôtel, chaque pièce de l'hôtel correspondant à une case de l'échiquier. La partie oppose sa famille à sa troupe et permettra de déterminer lesquels d'entre eux hériteront de la lourde tâche d'achever et de mettre en scène ses oeuvres autobiographiques.",

		"abstract": "This essay seeks to illuminate a fascinating aspect of global popular culture - fandom - by devising an original analytic frame based in Religious Studies which demonstrates that fandoms not only provide their devotees with new mythologies and communities but also succeed in creating subjunctive 'as-if' worlds for their adherents, thus providing a real alternative to traditional religions rather than simply a crude imitation of them. The fandom being examined here is devoted to the Cthulhu Mythos, a series of short interwoven sci-fi horror stories about monstrous alien gods and their dealings with human beings. Born of the pen of pulp author H.P. Lovecraft during the 1920s, this unique brand of \"cosmic horror\" survived its author's death by continually mutating to this day, attracting a wide ranging group of individuals who have \"consecrated themselves\" to Lovecraft's literary legacy and \"long for the return of the monster gods\" he dreamed up.",

		"abstract": "Le présent travail a été réalisé en conclusion du cursus de Bachelor en Sciences de l’Information de la Haute École de Gestion de Genève. Il est réalisé sur un mandat de la Bibliothèque des Jeunes (BJ) de La Chaux-de-Fonds, en association avec la Bibliothèque de la Ville de La Chaux-de-Fonds (BV). Le mandat est lié à la présence d’un fonds de livres de jeu de rôle dans les collections de la BV depuis 2012. Ce fonds n’est pas valorisé au sein des collections et peine à trouver son public. Le mandat vise à explorer la vocation, les possibilités et les contraintes d’une offre de jeu de rôle en bibliothèque de lecture publique. Il s’agit plus spécifiquement, en lien avec le mandat : • De proposer une offre de jeu de rôle cohérente avec les besoins et les contraintes exprimés par la BJ : cette offre pourra s’orienter vers un fonds comme vers des activités de jeu de rôle dans le cadre de la BJ. • De proposer des recommandations pour la valorisation et la médiation du fonds de livres de jeu de rôle de la BV. Pour ce faire, un état de l’art du jeu de rôle en bibliothèque est effectué : la place du jeu en bibliothèque, mais également le jeu de rôle en lui-même sont analysés et expliqués, grâce à une revue de la littérature et des recherches complémentaires sur différents médias et au travers d’entretiens. L’état de l’art propose un volet pratique avec la réalisation de deux enquêtes : • L’une visant à identifier les profils et les moeurs des pratiquants de jeu de rôle. Les résultats sont ensuite analysés pour établir les caractéristiques de ce public ciblé par l’offre de la BV. • L’autre visant à recueillir les retours d’expériences de bibliothèques publiques ayant mis en place une offre de jeu de rôle. Cet examen de réalisations concrètes permet d’identifier des points clés de l’élaboration d’une telle offre. Finalement, d’après les conclusions de l’état de l’art et de l’état des lieux, je proposerai des recommandations concrètes qui devront ensuite permettre aux deux bibliothèques de La Chaux-de-Fonds d’orienter leur offre liée au jeu de rôle. Il s’agira de fournir des pistes de réflexion pour orienter le fonds de la BV vers de nouveaux publics, tel que les jeunes et les familles. Ainsi le fonds pourra s’ouvrir aux publics de la BJ, et cette dernière pourra avoir un outil pour intégrer la pratique du jeu de rôle dans son activité. Je proposerai également des recommandations en lien avec la médiation du fonds, de même que l’organisation d’activités de jeu de rôle dans les deux bibliothèques pour les différents publics et selon différentes modalités.

In this chapter, the author combines narrative analysis and player interviews with live-action roleplaying observations to assess in-game power and norms through the lenses of Realism (power) and Constructivism (norms). Drawing on liminality, or that in-game performances become emotionally real to the players, the author finds that Vampire: The Masquerade becomes a liminal space inside which players practice alternate political behaviors that magnify Realism’s and Constructivism’s most disturbing theoretical expectations.",

		"abstract": "Podcast fiction storytelling is an underdeveloped area of new media studies. There is a wealth of texts available suitable for exploration. The example ofThe Adventure Zonein particular presents a strong argument that the medium possesses its own singular strengths for storytelling.The Adventure Zoneis a fictional, audio-only, serialised podcast in which a narrative of both considerable length and depth is constructed through the playing of tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons. It is hosted by the McElroy brothers, Griffin, Justin, and Travis, along with their father, Clint.The Adventure Zonedemonstrates the unique qualities and noteworthy potential the podcast medium possesses. The McElroy family collaborates utilising comedy improv practices, which are strengthened by the game's mechanics and rules. The line between characters and players - along with the line between textual and metatextual, canonical and non-canonical, diegetic and non-diegetic data - is significantly blurred through instances such as self-reflexivity and popular culture references. The fourth wall is inapplicable toThe Adventure Zone. It is necessary to re-imagine it instead as a permeable curtain separating the players from the characters. The listeners are provided with a clear view of not only the story ofThe Adventure Zone, but the construction of its creation. There are few mediums in which the audience can so effectively and candidly witness the storytelling process. Comparisons drawn from the original text -The Adventure Zonepodcast - to its ongoing adaptations -The Adventure Zonegraphic novels - illustrates this fact further. The collaborative, improvisational, metafictional qualities of the dynamic audio-only medium of podcasts are absent from static visual mediums.",

		"abstract": "This article introduces the concept of the ludic bestiary, a game mechanic that the authors argue produces abject bodies. Using the \"hag\" inDungeons & Dragonsas a case study, the authors demonstrate how the game's bestiary, theMonster Manual, functions as a tool of patriarchal control by defining, categorizing, and classifying the body of the female other as evil, abject, and monstrous. Importantly, the ludic bestiary not only exists as a core rulebook inDungeons & Dragonsbut has also been remediated as a narrative-heavy submenu in several digital games. The authors find that the figure of the monstrous woman persists in games because of the widespread distribution of theMonster Manualto young men in hobby communities, the cultural influence ofDungeons & Dragons, depictions of monstrosity that blend the erotic with the maternal, and the discursive categorization and objectification of the female body by ludic systems.",

		"abstract": "The twenty-first century has seen speculative fiction surge ever more vigorously into the mainstream, among which must be reckoned the remarkable renaissance of tabletop roleplaying games (Dungeons & Dragons especially), which generate fictional narratives through collaborative, improvisational, rule-constrained storytelling. D&D, this article argues, not only contains a remarkable array of politically and theologically implicative contents (such as agonistic cosmologies and racial hierarchies) but also entails and incentivizes theopolitically significant social practices on the part of participants – most significantly, narrating player-characters into and through moral dilemmas. Attending to players’ testimonies of personal renewal and political resistance, we find that D&D is an arena for what I theorize as edification: an enrichment of one’s subjectivity that is experienced as beneficial, transformational, or even salvific (that is, as effecting rescue or liberation from ruinous ways of life), even as it proves culturally contested and socially divisive.",

Over 2,500 participants were surveyed about what information they sought, what resources they used, and why. While participants’ purposeful information seeking was fairly similar to habits described in other studies of everyday life information seeking, participants had strong opinions about what resources were missing from the realm of existing D&D resources and what was most important to them when selecting a resource for use. Among the most common concerns were ease of access, cost of access (both temporal and monetary), validity of information, consolidation of information, and the feel of the resource.",

		"abstract": "The dissertation discusses the use and impact of “literary” framing (as by Werner Wolf) in generating and negotiating fictional spaces, narratives and meanings within the medium of tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs). In a second step, the text describes some of the specific and most salient framing features and strategies used by players during game sessions. By analyzing these through actual gameplay it is possible to identify the ‘transceptional’ border (Bunia) between reality and fiction to be the constitutive moment of role-play where players are both aware of, and immersed in, the fiction they collaboratively construct. Finally, the dissertation adapts Wolf’s theoretical framework in order to discuss and analyze the often overlooked category of “storytelling” TRPGs - one that, as the text argues, rather than focusing on narrative as such, aims at creating gameplay texts with heightened aesthetic and literary value while also enabling players to experience particular forms of immersion and deep emotional involvement. In the conclusion, the dissertation proposes re-conceptualizing literary framing as a defining characteristic of the fictional practice in general across media. In this regard, the dissertation argues, TRPGs reveal how framings are used and adapted in order to enable a specific mode of human interaction which is based on the figuration of emotional complexes via fictional “masks.”",

Millions tune in to watch and listen to RPG players on podcasts and streaming platforms, while virtual tabletops connect online players. Such shifts elicit new scholarly perspectives. This collection includes essays on the transmedia ecology that has connected analog with digital and audio spaces. Essays explore the boundaries of virtual tabletops and how users engage with a variety of technology to further role-playing. Authors map the growing diversity of the TRPG fandom and detail how players interact with RPG-related podcasts. Interviewed are content creators like Griffin McElroy of The Adventure Zone podcast, Roll20 co-creator Nolan T. Jones, board game designers Nikki Valens and Isaac Childres and fan artists Tracey Alvarez and Alex Schiltz. These essays and interviews expand the academic perspective to reflect the future of role-playing.",

		"abstract": "Role-play as a Heritage Practice is the first book to examine physically performed role-enactments, such as live-action role-play (LARP), tabletop role-playing games (TRPG), and hobbyist historical reenactment (RH), from a combined game studies and heritage studies perspective.  Demonstrating that non-digital role-plays, such as TRPG and LARP, share many features with RH, the book contends that all three may be considered as heritage practices. Studying these role-plays as three distinct genres of playful, participatory and performative forms of engagement with cultural heritage, Mochocki demonstrates how an exploration of the affordances of each genre can be valuable. Showing that a player’s engagement with history or heritage material is always multi-layered, the book clarifies that the layers may be conceptualised simultaneously as types of heritage authenticity and as types of in-game immersion. It is also made clear that RH, TRPG and LARP share commonalities with a multitude of other media, including video games, historical fiction and film. Existing within, and contributing to, the fiction and non-fiction mediasphere, these role-enactments are shaped by the same large-scale narratives and discourses that persons, families, communities, and nations use to build memory and identity. Role-play as a Heritage Practice will be of great interest to academics and students engaged in the study of heritage, memory, nostalgia, role-playing, historical games, performance, fans and transmedia narratology.",

		"abstract": "In this thesis I posit that sound – including music, the voice, and ambient and environmental noises – is necessary for creating immersive environments in tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs). It is the first ethnomusicological study to examine the role of sound in these TRPGs, although previous, related musicological scholarship has focused on video game and computer role-playing games (Cheng, 2014; Miller, 2012). Throughout the thesis, I draw on my own experiences with these games, participant-observation and observation of other TRPG groups, and interviews I completed with eighteen informants. Through analysis and interpretation of data collected using these fieldwork methods, I examine specific examples of how music is used in gaming sessions, explore how the use of music relates to Daniel Mackay’s “imaginary-entertainment environment” (2001), and offer the term “movie simile” to describe common comparisons that players make between film and TRPG soundtracks. My theoretical framework on voice draws from Brian Kane’s model (2014) to discuss how players utilize echos, logos, topos, and technê to create meaning and worlds in their games, as well as to illustrate how real-life experiences with the voice affect a player’s reception of natural and character voices. Additionally, I offer the term “haptic audition” to describe how tactility and space affect the ways in which players experience these sonic gaming environments. Throughout the thesis, I describe my model of sonic and perceptual layers that include the musical layer, the vocal layer, and the third and fourth layers, which include ambient and environmental noises, respectively.",

As an example, this article describes a class in which students represented seven modern Jews with diverse perspectives on altruistic love, kindness, and compassion and engaged in character with questions regarding gender, violence, and who is included in the commandment to love one's fellow, among other issues. This article explores how such role-playing engaged students and challenged them to think critically about the views of others, the construction of virtue, the diversity of modern Jewish ethical traditions, and their own approaches to ethics.",

		"abstract": "Dread Trident examines the rise of imaginary worlds in tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs), such as Dungeons and Dragons. With the combination of analog and digital mechanisms, from traditional books to the internet, new ways of engaging the fantastic have become increasingly realized in recent years, and this book seeks an understanding of this phenomenon within the discourses of trans- and posthumanism, as well as within a gameist mode. The book explores a number of case studies of foundational TRPGs. Dungeons and Dragons provides an illustration of pulp-driven fantasy, particularly in the way it harmonizes its many campaign settings into a functional multiverse. It also acts as a supreme example of depth within its archive of official and unofficial published material, stretching back four decades. Warhammer 40k and the Worlds of Darkness present an interesting dialogue between Gothic and science-fantasy elements. The Mythos of HP Lovecraft also features prominently in the book as an example of a realized world that spans the literary and gameist modes. Realized fantasy worlds are becoming ever more popular as a way of experiencing a touch of the magical within modern life. Reworking Northrop Frye's definition of irony, Dread Trident theorizes an ironic understanding of this process and in particular of its embodied forms.",

We connect PC death to player agency and in doing so connect death to downtime and other play modes in which players have less or no control of their PCs. We discuss how PC death affects gameplay by breaking up time, by ending or starting a period of play, or by reinforcing or severing player and PC connections. The objective of this analysis is to improve our understanding of PC death, as well as PC life and the control, agency and play associated with it.",

		"abstract": "With the new possibilities of social media and streaming services, some narratives like table-top role-playing games seem to find their way through pop culture. Their repercussion and referencing in TV shows and the Internet support the increasing awareness in pop culture at the same time that this sort of games is re-configured to meet the modern times in media, keeping their essence of pen, paper and friends around a table. This dissertation analyses the influence of the game in modern texts through its highest representative, Dungeons & Dragons. The successful show Stranger Things serves the purpose of analysing how the nostalgia created around the eighties and its aesthetic use of Dungeons & Dragons as vehicle for the main elements of plot and the focalised vision of the same. The live streaming of role-play sessions has also helped in this spread of the community, like Critical Role, allowing a higher engagement of the audience through the ease of the relaxed atmosphere of friends enjoying their hobby, yet reaching almost a professional level of production and writing. The analysis also discusses the roots of this game in the work of J. R. R. Tolkien and H. P. Lovecraft, highlighting several points of the game like the characterisation of the races, influenced by the concepts in Tolkien’s literature and the addition of a dark element from the cosmic horror genre, introducing recognisable elements of vulnerability, horror and antagonists’ new definitions.",

		"abstract": "Players sit around a table. A group of adventurers pause in their pursuit of escape. Stunned, they stare at the die that just rolled poorly, resulting in the loss of a dear friend, his throat ripped out because they could not save him. The players mourn the death of a fictional character who only ever existed within the game. Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a popular role-playing game illustrating the interconnectedness of drama, performance, and games. My presentation will examine this relationship, identifying factors from gameplay that suggest how performance fosters success in D&D for both actual players and fictional characters. Research into dramatic theory and game theory reveals how interdisciplinary concepts such as the “magic circle”, the “lusory attitude”, and uncertainty can apply to elements of D&D (Salen and Zimmerman, Suits, Costikyan). Data collected from in-person observation of D&D sessions, coding participants’ behaviour, and watching for instances of performance (e.g. voice change, pronoun switches, or mimetic gesture), has been combined with theoretical research to determine elements that better facilitate success in the game/campaign. These elements range from emotional situations that provoke players, to forms of invitations encouraging participation (Isbister, White). I have discovered that while in theatre performance acts as a vehicle for story, in D&D the story acts as a vehicle for performance. The in-game performance often facilitates fun between players, as well as leading them to success in the game, so a campaign that maximizes theatricality will not only result in more fun, but also more success.\nWorks Cited\nCostikyan, Greg. Uncertainty in Games.

		"abstract": "In 1974, Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson created the world’s first role-playing\ngame, Dungeons & Dragons. D&D offered an entirely new avenue for readers to interact\nwith fantasy literature; instead of simply reading fantastic novels, players were welcome to\ninhabit their worlds. This thesis provides both a contextualization of D&D within our literary\nhistory – as a narrative-creating game which relies on performance for its actualization – and\nan analysis of two of the primary texts responsible for its game world diegesis: Poul\nAnderson’s Three Hearts and Three Lions and Fritz Leiber’s Fafhrd and Gray Mouser cycle\nof stories. This analysis offers a generative method for examining artistic influences on the\nnascent medium of tabletop roleplaying, a new ergodic form of literature. Through an\nanalysis of Anderson’s novel and Leiber’s short stories, we are able to understand how\nGygax constructed a new post-modern mythological canon, by interpellating literary\nelements, perspectives, and narrative decisions, from the popular fictions of early\n20th century pulp fiction that he catalogued in D&D’s Appendix N. This investigation\nilluminates the importance of literary tradition for creating new legends for our games, in our\nclassic analog field and in our emerging digital landscape, and argues for the necessity of\nencouraging further curiosity into how our literary traditions shape the imaginations of our\npresent and future game designers, developers, and artists.",

Les autres créent et interprètent les héros d’une intrigue qui va se nouer et se dénouer au fil du dialogue et des jets de dés : ce sont les joueurs. Certains de ces « rôlistes » peuvent improviser durant des heures en imaginant simplement le décor et les protagonistes autour de leur personnage au fil de l’action. Mais ils choisissent pour la plupart de jouer leur personnage dans un monde qui préexiste à leurs parties et dans lequel d’autres aventures pourront se dérouler.\nCes mondes présentent la particularité d’être construits sur au moins trois niveaux. On y accède d’abord par les ressources encyclopédiques fournies dans le manuel du jeu, qui constitue une sorte de « bible » créative pour ses utilisateurs…",

In this presentation, I will provide an introduction to one such medium: tabletop role-playing games (RPGs). I will focus on independently- created RPGs and the ways in which they can be integrated into library programming. My discussion of the theoretical aspects draws on examples from various games and systems, but I will also give a brief overview of three indie RPGs -- Follow, Be Witching, and The Deep Forest -- that can be used in programs, as well as some general tips for facilitating games.",

		"abstract": "Roleplaying games have always leaned heavily on their literary sources. System mechanics and character creation options have been tooled toward evoking genre types and aesthetics ever since the first “Vancian wizard” memorised a spell before setting out to adventure. \nNaturally, when RPGs turned toward the Gothic, they did the same thing: riffing off the assembled archetypes and stereotypes of myth, film and literature to create an infrastructure of characters for players to occupy and navigate. \nThis paper explores the most overtly Gothic RPG yet designed, analysing two different approaches to establishing a framework of archetypes that will be familiar to players while also curating a particular aesthetic mood. \nVampire: the Masquerade​ bakes literary references into its heavily stereotyped clans and sects, strongly associating the two and extending the game experience step by step into new and broader territories. \nVampire: the Requiem presents five recognisable archetypes, more clearly derived from particular mythic, filmic or literary concepts of the vampire, and five thematic political groups that interact with them in a way offering greater variety. \nThis paper will establish the Gothic credentials and objectives of the two games in their own terms, explore how the playable character options embody and serve the games’ vision of the Gothic, and proceed toward a classic ‘compare and contrast’ conclusion, looking at how successive editions of the games have modernised these archetypes to meet evolving perceptions of what exactly Gothic roleplaying should be.",

A part of the argument\nis concerned with a relatively weak position of Dungeons & Dragons in\nPoland compared to the English market and with the Polish RPG players’ lack\nof interest in the market of digital materials for tabletop RPGs. The main\nhypothesis, however, connects the Polish absence from community content\nprograms with how the long absence of professional systems and the permanently\nsmall market of commercial RPGs in Poland might have increased\nthe intensity of prosumption of RPGs among Polish fans but simultaneously\nlimited their chance to gain skills and knowledge necessary to publish and\nmarket the results of this prosumption on a professional or semi-professional\nlevel. Statements of Jan Sielicki – the only Polish RPG designer who\npublished numerous and successful supplements under community content\nprograms – are quoted to reinforce this hypothesis and show how Sielicki\ngained the necessary skills outside of the Polish RPG fandom.",

		"abstract": "The current study aims to observe whether individuals who engaged in table-top role playing game (TRPG) were more creative. Participants total 170 (52 TRPG players, 54 electronic role playing game (ERPG) players and 64 Non-players) aged from 19 to 63. In the current study, an online questionnaire is used, adopting the verbal subtests of Wallach–Kogan Creativity Tests and the McCrae and Costa Big Five Personality Inventory. It is found that TRPG players score higher in divergent thinking tests. Priming and instruction giving methods lower the performance of all participants, in particular, when the instruction is memory provoking. ERPG players score lowest among the three groups. TRPG could be regarded as a form of improvisation. It could also be a preferable activity for the promotion of creativity. It is low cost and no formal setting is required to play. Many ERPGs are originated from TRPGs, therefore, with the popularity of ERPG, there should be advantages in promoting TRPG.",

Although D&D may appear to be a game of simple make-believe, the emotions, camaraderie, and accomplishments experienced by players are real, thus suggesting that RPGs have real-world implications for players. Therefore, the goal of this study is to explore the ways in which players fulfill social needs through group communication during the context of D&D table-top role-play. Utilizing Bormann's (1972) fantasy theme analysis, this study uses a case study approach to identify four themes which emerged within player talk on Facebook: (1) democratic ideologies; (2) friendship maintenance; (3) extraordinary experiences; and (4) good versus evil. Findings provide a description of group members' real-world needs met through symbolic in-game interactions evidenced by communicative markers.",

This work had as objective determine what is the conception that the systematic players possess regarding the games of characters’ interpretation, or Role-Playing Games, as well as the motivational factors that lead to the practice of this game. It was used for the collection of the data a partner-demographic questionnaire and a semi-open interview; the last one was analyzed based on certain categories that started from the themes that were raised. The categories demonstrated that RPG is viewed as an improvised theater, a leisure activity, a therapy, a personality projection, a facilitator of personal relationships and as an opportunity to meet friends. It was certain that the players’ main motivation was friendship, the will of being with the game companions. The game of RPG possesses positive characteristics as much as negatives, and the difference would be in the way it is used. The result of the research makes way for future studies on that kind of game that is already inserted in the mass culture.",

The present study aimed to examine how role-playing games influence creative potential and emotional creativity. Participants were assigned into either a treatment group (N = 19) or a control group (N = 20). After taking the Emotional Creativity Index (ECI) and Abbreviated Torrance Test for Adults (ATTA) as pre-tests, the treatment group played TRPGs once every week for four weeks. Upon the completion of the treatment, the participants retook the tests. The control group only took the pre-tests and post-tests and did not play any role-playing games. The results showed treatment group significantly enhance their creative potential as compared with the control group, but not on emotional creativity.

Among deficits previously identified by researchers working with students served through special education are delays in oral language development and greater externalization in locus of control, a construct of personality. This study investigates the effects of simulation game play upon remediation of these deficit areas. Participating in the study were 26 mildly handicapped adolescents. The experimental group, consisting of 13 students, played Dungeons and Dragons, a fantasy-based role-playing game, during 18 sessions. All participants were administered individual tests utilizing the Utah Test of Language Development, Revised Edition and the Intellectual Achievement Responsibility Questionnaire after the final session of play.\nFindings and Conclusions. One-way analysis of variance tests using the difference between the group means on (1) oral language development and (2) internal versus external locus of control was applied. A significant difference was found to exist at the .05 level in oral language development. A significant difference was found to exist at the .05 level in internalization of locus of control. These findings tend to support the contention that a simulation game format is a viable remediation tool when used with mildly handicapped adolescents. Further, these findings support past research findings with both disabled and nondisabled participants.",

This is in contrast to the way that the vision and creativity of famous designers (e.g. Steve Jobs, Burt Rutan, Dean Kamen, etc.) are admired and celebrated. How do we help students to develop their creativity and incorporate their voice into the process? How can we also help them to improve the quality of the ideas that they inject into the design process? A course in creativity and creativity techniques was developed as a prototype to test creativity teaching techniques for subsequent incorporation into a capstone design sequence. The primary creativity mechanism was to utilize art both as a prism for new ways of seeing and as a vehicle to explore design in collaboration with the Barnes Foundation of Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Students in this course explored techniques to help them find their creative core and ways to use art as a prism to see engineering design from multiple perspectives. To achieve these learning goals and to free students from potential self-limiting behaviors in discussing non-technical matters, role-playing as part of a popular role-playing game was utilized to enable students to approach creativity and creativity techniques from their character's perspective. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.",

		"abstract": "The school should be the place of excellence to learn. However, learning means much more than acquiring specific content in academic subjects. Assuming that the training in the school should be based on the autonomy and flexibility of the curriculum, and that meaningful learning requires several literacies [1], multiple theoretical and practical skills, promotion of scientific knowledge, intellectual curiosity, critical thinking, creativity and collaborative work and the 21st century skills are feasible through game-based learning [2] or playful literacy [3]. So, this article reports on a role-play game experience aimed at these competencies and specially to interpersonal relationships and self-concept. The experience was presented, following a request for a psychoeducational intervention in a school group with complaints of behavior, challenge to authority, breach of norms and lack of cordial conduct, attitudes of conflict, with great heterogeneity of ages, socio-cultural provenance and suspicious situations of (pre) bullying among students. The experience consisted on the interpretation of characters in a role-play table-top game (RPG) inspired by Dungeons and Dragons (D&D or DnD) [4]. The characters move themselves in a fantasy adventure while actively constructing a story, in an open world of possibilities where each participant decides within the limits of the reasonability allowed by the others and the contexts presented by the narrator, or D-Master (DM). The narrator organizes the game, creates the details describing to the players what they see and hear, presents the challenges, maintaining a realistic continuity of events while controlling the development of the adventure, except in the actions of the characters. Everyone play and take own decisions to solve the problems faced and described by the DM. The decisions are discussed and a consensus must arise or is determined by the narrator's orientations in accordance with the fate and consequences of rolling the dice. Playing the game suppose immersion in the scenarios presented, acceptance of the challenge and a state of flow or focus shifted from the real world to the game world, social interaction and affect generated. So, by participating in the game, the 24 students of the 7th grade participating were encouraged to put into practice values and competencies identified to be essential to develop themselves as individuals and members of a group. After a period of 5 sessions, the individual experiences were assessed in terms of flow, self-competence, affection towards the others using de Game User Questionnaire [5]. All the participants expressed pleasure in participating and availability to continue the experience, noting their improved ability to regulate the mood and social behaviour. They also revealed interest in deepening different themes, that means, availability to learn. The students, teachers as well as the observers concluded that the approach was pertinent and should go on within the school context to promote competencies.",

		"abstract": "The author explored the literacy practices in tabletop gaming communities. Focusing on the role of spatiality and materiality in nondigital contexts, this study broadens how literacies research engages with sociocultural analysis of primarily analog settings. Building on experiences in playing the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, the author analyzed how literacies shape the collaborative storytelling and interpretation of complex rules mechanics required for play. The author drew on 26 months of collected ethnographic data, including participant observation of hundreds of hours of tabletop role-playing game sessions, interviews, and textual analysis. Describing how gaming literacy practices are enacted, the findings from this study identify three different spaces in which analog literacies often emerge: in-game literacies, at-the-table literacies, and beyond-the-table literacies. Exploring how participants read, produce, and communicate in ways that move across these domains, the author emphasizes the roles of temporality and spatiality in understanding contemporary literacies. Further, as Dungeons & Dragons is mediated by myriad books and physical objects, such as dice, sheets of paper, and small figurines, the role of materiality in analog literacies differs substantially from digital contexts. At the same time, exploring the cultural practices and talk that shaped play, the author emphasizes that analog gaming remains connected to the digital affordances of online texts, transmedia production, and tools for communication. By considering how seemingly archaic gaming practices recast literacies research around games and learning, the author argues for continued scrutiny of these playful domains.",

		"abstract": "This qualitative study aimed to describe player experiences from playing Dungeons & Dragons. Research\nquestions sought to identify which experiences were meaningful, beneficial, and appealing about the game.\nThrough purposive non-random sampling, a total of 60 respondents answered the survey between June and\nAugust 2016. Majority of respondents were male, within the age range of 25 - 34 years, and having at least 1 -\n3 years of experience. Thematic analysis was used to categorize the data acquired through an online survey.\nThe researcher categorized keywords into three core elements: Creative, Emotional, and Social Experiences.\nThe findings show that there is no doubt role-playing games such as D&D have the potential to entertain, heal,\nand educate. Psychological implications include D&D and TRPGs alike to be used in both therapeutic and\neducational settings. When designed thoughtfully and facilitated carefully, RPGs can help clients understand\nthemselves on a deeper level, or discover something new about them. Even for regular players, RPGs can be a\nplayground to exercise social and cognitive skills.",

It is divided in three main parts: the first part introduces the concept and origins of RPGs and briefly discusses their communicative and collaborative aspects; the second part approaches the RPG systematic to the concepts of communicative language teaching (CLT), task based learning (TBL), and active learning as a means to demonstrate how EFL learners can benefit from an approach that involves RPGs; the third part describes and discusses the learning outcomes of a set of RPG based tasks that were developed and used in an EFL context with a group of nine teenagers aging from 12 to 17 years old during their fourth semester in a language school. The article closes with considerations on how RPG based learning can help learners develop not only their speaking and interpersonal skills, but also autonomy.",

		"abstract": "Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPG) like Dungeons & Dragons are unique\nphenomena within the topics of game-based learning and gamification of leadership\ndevelopment. Games in general are used for both game-based learning (learning from\nplaying games) and as sources of inspiration for gamification: the application of game\ndesign elements in non-game contexts like business or education. Many potential benefits\nof playing TRPGs have been observed including transformative experiences linked to\ncollective creativity. Knowing more about the transformative potential of TRPGs can\ninform facilitation of creative learning environments and guide the use of TRPGs for\nleadership development.\nThe concept of a holding environment frames play and creativity as activities that\npromote personal growth embedded in a psychological or group environment. Drawing\nfrom a developmental environment framework, a gaming environment can be considered\nas the psychological group environment present while playing a TRPG. Applying this\ndevelopmental environment framework to TRPG groups builds on previous research that\nreports transformative growth in TRPG experiences by providing a group level of\nanalysis. This research explored gaming environments in TRPGs, specifically Dungeons\n& Dragons 5th Edition (D&D 5e).\nThis qualitative study employed content analysis, group observations, and\ninterviews for data collection and analysis. A group of participants was solicited to play\nD&D 5e specifically for this research. Thematic analysis was used to identify group\ninteraction patterns by observing the group playing D&D 5e over the course of several\nsessions. Then, semi-structured interviews with the participants were conducted to\ninvestigate individual perspectives of specific observations from the group sessions.\nInterview topics included descriptions of the group of players, defining events in the\ngroup, and factors influencing the play experience. Recordings of gaming sessions and\ntranscripts of individual interviews were subjected to continued analysis. Findings\nindicated that the gaming environment was a psychologically layered container which\ndepended on the use of authority in leader-member relationships and utilized framing and\nstorytelling processes for containing emotions. These findings can be used to inform the\ndesign of TRPGs for leadership development and expand how we construct knowledge\nabout group environments in creative contexts.",

		"abstract": "In this paper, we explain how applied ethnographic research and games share many vital aspects, specifically in the domains of design and learning. On the surface, these fields might appear to be worlds apart, but we found many congruities between them. Both follow a variety of analogous methodologies, including a focus on iterative design, peer-reviewed testing processes, design-led creative approaches to problem-solving, and the use of multidisciplinary practices to create more substantial results. Moreover, both fields strive to create relevant materials for their clients, and rely on both qualitative and quantitative methods of assessment. Additionally, the interactive learning and knowledge sharing fa-cilitated by tabletop roleplaying games function similarly to the way multidisciplinary research teams collaborate to solve real world problems. These parallels have implications for new directions in applied anthropology education and research design. We note how these fields both encourage their practitioners to syncretize skills and knowledge in areas beyond their training, and suggest techniques which can hopefully benefit social science researchers working in a wide range of settings. Additionally, we present ideas for the creation of collaborative learning environments, adaptations to field school training techniques, and the design of collaborative research forums.",

		"abstract": "In traditional drama, an audience watches a story presented by characters on a stage. Interactive Drama changes the audience to a single User who enters that stage, interacting with the characters, and participating in the story. Computer-based interactive drama allows a User to interact with simulated worlds which are inhabited by dynamic and complex autonomous characters and shaped by a flexible, aesthetically pleasing story. Unlike the actions of characters in a play, the actions of the User are not controlled by the artist. The problem is to shape the User's experience to conform to the set of themes and ideas to be conveyed. This work proposes this problem can be solved by dynamically monitoring and subtly guiding the experience of the User.\n\nThis dissertation describes an architecture called Moe that is designed to provide dramatic guidance. Moe uses abstract, adversary search with an aesthetic evaluation function to decide how and when to guide the User's experience. The first technical achievement of this work is a demonstration of the ability to capture a dramatic aesthetic (for one interactive drama) in an automated evaluation function that can examine an experience and determine its quality, much as a movie critic determines the quality of a film. This result is supported by statistically demonstrating a high degree of correlation (r =.87) between the evaluation function and the human artist.\n\nThe second main technical achievement of this work is the implementation of three such strategies (SAS and SAS+, both based on random sampling; and MMFC, which uses memoization to implement a full-depth search) and a search state that seem capable of effectively modelling and guiding an interactive dramatic experience. Moe has not yet been connected to a running interactive experience, but instead Moe has been tested with a variety of Simulated User Types. On \"average\" Users, SAS, SAS+, and MMFC are able to improve Users' experiences from the 50th percentile, to the 94th, 98th, and 99th percentile, respectively. This is a large and artistically meaningful increase.\n\nThis dissertation describes the first implementation of a system designed to provide centralized dramatic guidance in an interactive drama.",

Drawing on\nunobtrusive behavioral data captured by the game, combined with a large survey and\ntraditional ethnographic methods, the study found that role players both negotiate\nidentity and use their time online as a moratorium for their offline lives.\nDescriptive results showed that role players are a relatively small, but psycholo-\ngically burdened subgroup. When examined from the theoretical perspectives of\nGoffman’s Self-Presentation theory, Huizenga’s Magic Circle, and Turkle’s early\nwork on online identity formation, these players were seen as largely using virtual\nspaces as creative outlets and for socialization. The worlds also functioned as coping\nmechanisms for players frequently unable to gain acceptance, social connectivity or\nsocial support offline due to their personal situation, psychological profile, or their\nminority status.",

His early upbring led him to extreme isolation of affect and a fear of fragmentation. His inner life was not safely reachable by conventional therapy. After he became involved in playing a fantasy game, Dungeons and Dragons, the therapy was modified to use the game material as displaced, waking fantasy. This fantasy was used as a safe guide to help the patient learn to acknowledge and express his inner self in a safe and guided way. The patient ultimately matured and developed healthier object relations and a better life. The theoretical underpinnings of this process are explored, both in dynamic terms and in terms of the biologic correlation and equivalence of dreams and waking fantasy.

		"abstract": "Australian National University honors paper in medical anthropology on the use of RPG in the self-treatment of clinical depression. This essay is an exploration of the thesis that healing as a cultural process can be the product of the manipulation of a symbolic framework of meaning. In such a process, the central concepts are those of passivity, empowerment, and the creation of meaningful cultural metaphors for the causal illness/ state of mind (Young 1977, Kovel 1976). The essay focuses on one particular case from what might be characterised as a developing system. The western recreational activity of roleplaying has been in existence for little over ten years, and in its initial self-conceptualisation was a variation on traditional wargaming. Yet such has been the pace of its development that certain groups are consciously experimenting with its potential for healing along lines that parallel certain psychotherapies and indigenous healing systems. My case study focuses on one roleplayer, “Malori” (a pseudonym) and the way in which she employs her roleplaying and visualisation skills to assist her in dealing with a disabling endogenous depression. In doing so I seek to identify the essential elements of the process and the structural characteristics of certain roleplaying groups which allow the potential for healing to be present. In concentrating on the construction of personal symbols through the creation of roleplaying personas or “characters”, my analysis will essentially be a semiotic one.",

Though players often find the RPG experience enjoyable, the process of assuming an alternate identity in a world parallel to the mundane can produce powerful psychological effects. RPGs are used widely in various applications, including theater, therapy, education, military training, and leisure and possess the capability to transform human interactions and enhance valuable skill sets. Engagement in roleplaying creates the potential for self-exploration in the form of identity alteration, problem-solving in the form of scenario building, and establishment of communitas as a modern-day ritual practice.",

À quelle réalité contemporaine renvoie ce mythe anciennement tombé en désuétude ? Le vampire fascine et revient en force au travers de la littérature (Anne Rice), du cinéma (Dracula, Entretien avec un vampire, Blade, Vampires, La reine des damnés, Underworld, Twilight…), des jeux de rôles (Vampire : la Mascarade), de la musique et des tendances de la mode (gothique). Nos jeunes patients, adolescents fascinés par les vampires, semblent nous dire combien ce mythe met en musique une certaine réalité psychique et culturelle. Nos travaux sur l’évolution des modèles familiaux semblent pouvoir nous donner des pistes pour comprendre cette fascination contemporaine à l’égard du vampire. Il est étonnant de voir combien les traits prêtés à ces créatures légendaires font écho aux caractéristiques psychopathologiques contemporaines que nous avons déjà décrites et mises en lien avec l’évolution des valeurs tant dans notre société que dans la famille. Cet article tente donc un parallèle clinique avec le mythe en proposant une explication de cet intérêt contemporain pour les vampires.",

		"abstract": "Identity theory argues that the self (i.e., viewing oneself from the standpoint of others) is composed of multiple identities, or internalized positional designations. Salience, or the probability of an identity being invoked in a given situation, is argued to have two causes, interactional commitment (embeddedness in an identity-related network) and affective commitment (emotional gratification derived from an identity), and to in turn result in identity-related behavior. This dissertation addresses three limitations of past research: the neglect of leisure identities, the operationalization of behavior as time spent in role rather than as specific types of behavior, and the failure to include all four identity theory concepts in a single study. Data were collected in July 1983 for 113 boys (aged 10 to 17) attending a camp devoted to Dungeons and Dragons gaming. Campers completed surveys administered each of the five days of camp. Factor analyses established scales of each concept, while path analyses determined the relationships among the concepts. The results indicate the importance of delineating among types of behavior; interactional commitment consistently affects social behaviors, while affective commitment consistently affects solitary behaviors. Both types of commitment affect materialistic behavior. Dividing the sample on such variables as age and the length of time one had been gaming indicates that involvement with social behavior occurs the longer one has been gaming; this can be seen as support for one's ability and inclination to role-make, the search for self-validation, and development within identities. Contrary to the theory, interactional commitment is seldom related to salience, and salience rarely affects behavior. Identity theorists studying adolescents are urged to consider the possibility that the salience hierarchy of teens and pre-teens may be so unstable or ill-formed that weak or anomalous findings with regard to salience may result.",

The art therapy process provided the patient with an outlet for his anger and depression through the art media. Through problem-solving skills and decision making during the sessions, the patient gained a sense of mastery and control within his limited and restricted environment. It is suggested that art therapy serves as a creative tool in which adolescents can express feelings and issues crucial to their recovery. The art process further aids adolescents in developing their sense of identity and self-esteem, as well as preserving their autonomy by giving them a sense of mastery and control. It is concluded that both the therapist and patient need to work together to promote healing and growth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

Here I suggest that the subject's engagement with advertising and entertainment may take the form of enthrallment, a mental state characterized by simultaneous engrossment and disbelief.\n In this article, I describe one sort of entertainment activity, science-fiction-based, roleplaying games. I argue that enthrallment manifests itself here in a form of the first-person pronoun that occurs in the speech of the players.",

Fifty participants completed an assessment packet that included the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), the Spiritual Perspective Scale (SPS), the D & D questionnaire (DDQ), and a demographics questionnaire. The mean MBTI scores were compared with the national averages using a one-sample t-test analysis. The participants reported personality types involving significantly more introversion, t(49) = -4.07, p < 0.001; more intuition, t(49) = -5.69, p < .001; and more perception, t(49) = -2.36, p < .05, than the reported national averages (all tests two-tailed). The sample did not differ significantly in terms of thinking versus feeling functions. With the SPS and DDQ each having a potential range of 1-6, participants found the traits of increased strategy (M = 5.82), imagination development (M = 5.32), creation and maintenance of friendships (M = 5.26) and expression of alter egos (M = 5.78) to be influenced and facilitated by D & D. Participants also scored significantly in the categories of spirituality’s importance on meaning of life (M = 5.26) and influence on one’s life (M = 5.4) showing a correlation between D & D and spirituality.",

		"abstract": "Despite the prevalence of Fantasy Role Playing Games (FRPGs) in North American society, and the concern over the possible negative side effects that such games may have on their players, empirical research dealing with Fantasy Role Playing is quite lacking. The characteristics of players of FRPGs were compared to non-players through the administration of measures of psychopathology (TSC-40, RSE), dissociation (DES), IQ (Shipley's Institute of Living Scale), imagery ability (Absorption, Betts Imagery Vividness, PPI (XT)), fantasy proneness (ICMI), and hypnotizability (CURSS:O).\nFRPG subjects (n = 45) and control subjects (n = 45) were found to be indistinguishable by scores on psychopathology measures. FRPG players were found, however, to have elevated IQ, Absorption, Fantasy Proneness, and Temporal Lobe Lability scores. While hypnotic susceptibility was not found to differentiate the groups, Absorption, Frequency of FRPG play, and Number of FRPG systems experienced, were found to significantly predict hypnotic susceptibility within the FRPG group. The presence of the gaming variables as significant predictors shows variance in susceptibility not explained through imagery ability, nor other established predictors in the literature.\nFactor analysis suggests that involvement in FRPGs is less a correlate of imagery ability than it is of a tendency towards fantasy.",

		"abstract": "This dissertation examines the identity implications of table-top role-playing fantasy games. Based on nineteen months of participant-observation of a gaming group, twenty in-depth interviews, and archival data from email lists and websites, I show gamers used gaming to construct a moral identity, court self-testing risks, and explore possible selves. Gamers created the moral identity \"good gamer\" through display of six qualities: dedication, cooperation, selflessness, creativity, intelligence, and authenticity. By displaying these qualities, gamers constructed themselves not only as good gamers, but as good people. Gamers courted self-testing risks by engaging in \"edgework without the edge.\" This involved gamers testing the limits of fantasy characters' abilities and putting those characters' lives, rather than their own, at risk. Gamers also engaged in fictive heroism, creating characters who were slightly better versions of themselves. By putting these characters through adventures and ordeals in a fictional game world, gamers explored alternative moralities and possible selves. My research shows how activities that are largely based on imagination and might be seen by many as frivolous can have serious real-world consequences. Future research might thus fruitfully examine how other activities that occur in virtual or imaginary worlds come to shape real-world identities and self-conceptions.",

		"abstract": "Permeated and referenced throughout popular culture, Dungeons & Dragons has become iconic as the cardinal and archetypal tabletop role-playing game, spawning its own genre of gaming. The past forty years have seen participants drawn to the game by notions of “fun” or “enjoyment”, however as some sociologists argue, there are elements of tautology to this reasoning. While this critique may offer verity, qualitative research would suggest participant rationale is at least superficially valid, yet evokes a call to further understanding. This paper offers a preliminary analysis of the underlying motivations for playing D&D examining concepts such as engrossment, identification, play, freedom, self-expression and various adverse affects associated with the game. Theoretically positioning Gary Alan Fine’s Shared Fantasy: Role- Playing Games as Social Worlds (1983) as the primary textual framework  underpinning this research, and juxtaposing this with a participant Internet survey (2014), this paper seeks to explore these factors, while acknowledging and maintaining the oft repeated maxim that the game is “fun”.",

		"abstract": "This study examined the levels of empathy and absorption of individuals who regularly play fantasy and science fiction role-playing games. A hypothesis was developed that higher levels of empathy would be found in individuals who fantasy role-play based upon previous research in hypnosis such as J. R. Hilgard’s (1970) imaginative involvement hypothesis, research into the “fantasy prone” personality type (Wilson & Barber, 1981), and the empathic involvement hypothesis (Wickramasekera II & Szlyk, 2003). The participants in the current study were 127 fantasy role-players who volunteered and completed the Davis Interpersonal Reactivity Index (empathy) and the Tellegen Absorption Scale (absorption). The results demonstrated that those who play fantasy role-playing games scored significantly higher than the comparison group on the IRI scale of empathy, confirming the hypothesis that fantasy role-players report experiencing higher levels of empathic involvement with others. Correlational analysis between the measures demonstrated a significant positive correlation between empathy and absorption (r = .43, p < .001). These results collectively suggest that fantasy role-players have a uniquely empathically-imaginative style. The results also confirm and extend previous findings on the relationship between empathy and absorption as predicted by the Empathic Involvement Hypothesis (Wickramasekera II & Szlyk, 2003).",

The tool is explored from an archetypal orientation and its applicability for other theoretical orientations was also considered. An artistic-creative approach is employed and responses from five adult participants were analyzed for themes.\nTTRI combines group work, play therapy, and therapeutic role-play under one intervention, using the imaginal realm to explore the participants' experiences. Analysis of participant responses suggests that TTRI is functional and useful with therapeutic groups. The results also indicate that TTRI may allow for the exploration of conscious and unconscious factors of behaviors and thought process.",

		"abstract": "Self-efficacy (SE), the theoretical basis for the study, is the internal belief that one is capable of appropriately addressing a given situation. High SE is linked to positive outcomes in diverse areas such as academics, health, and career. Therapeutic role play has been found to increase SE through mastery experiences, yet the correlation between roleplaying games (RPGs) and general and social SE has remained unexamined. In this study, the SE of gamers was examined for a statistically significant correlation between roleplaying activities and SE over that of the general, nonroleplaying population. A convenience sample of 414 adult gamers completed the General Self-efficacy Exam (GSE), Perceived Social Self-Efficacy scale (PSSE), and surveys of RPG activity and demographics. Findings showed a correlation between participation in RPGs and general SE [t(413) = 24.90, p <. 001], though not between RPGs and social SE. There was no overall correlation between time and general SE, though time was positively correlated with social SE (r = .083, p < .05). An ANOVA found that GMs have higher levels of both general [F(2, 411) = 30.92, p < .001] and social [F(2, 411) = 8.978, p < .001] SE than among individuals who were primarily players or who were equally players and GMs. The multidimensional importance of high SE throughout the life experience makes it vital to identify many avenues for improving SE. Knowledge of the correlation between RPGs and SE is an important contribution to existing literature, opening up the possibility of establishing a causal link between RPGs and SE through experimentation. Findings could enhance social change initiatives through identification of an inexpensive, easily-accessible, and enjoyable method for increasing SE across the lifespan.",

We departed from the supposition that the analysis of I-other interactions, during that game, could put in evidence relevant aspects for the comprehension of the relation between intersubjectivity and otherness in interpersonal contexts. The results of the microgenetic analysis of the dialogues among the players showed the participation of important psychological processes in human development. In those processes, moments of tension and disquiet - typical of otherness relationships - were alternated with moments of convergence and sharing about the topics of the dialogue, as well as about the relational positions of the interlocutors.",

It is about\nthe use of video games as a therapeutic tool, mobilizing of the symptomatology of the teenager.\nResults: “Pixels” workshops use playing according to three specific forms: the paper role-play game, the video game, and the\ncards playing game. Their specificity is that the participative adult shows a regressive ability strong enough to play with teenagers\nand is very careful to not interpret what takes place within.\nConclusions: “Passerelle” workshops demonstrate the link between the teenager’s mind and the use of his own virtual avatar. It\nallows to evolve from a “play together” to a “talk together”, a moment of symbolization and of being able to stand back in regards\nto his or her own recreational activities.

It fills many roles for me personally including as a creative outlet, a method to meet people, and simply as a fun hobby. Role playing will always be these things for me, but I also see a higher goal for role playing games.\n\nBut let me step back for a minute.\n\nI’m in four role playing groups and each group scratches a slightly different itch. One of my weeknight games is a great way to decompress after the work day. We eat snacks, sling some dice, and have a great time killing monsters and saving the",

		"abstract": "There is a paucity of research related to the motivation of people who play table-top role-playing games (TRPGs). Two questions drove this research: (1) What motivates people to play TRPGs and (2) Can a single supra-motivator be developed which envelopes a larger theory of why people participate in TRPGs? Grounded Theory methodology was used to investigate why people initiate and continue to participate in table-top role-playing games. Fourteen people who attended a 4-year college who played TRPGs and two people who did not play were interviewed regarding their participation in role-playing games. Open codes, emergent categories, conceptual categories, and a theoretical category indicated there exist two conceptual categories related to why people initiate participation in TRPGs and five conceptual categories related to why people continue to play TRPGs. These categories were linked together to develop the theoretical category of “becoming” to explain the motivations of people who play TRPGs. The emergent theory of becoming as motivation, limitations, and future directions for research are discussed within the interpretive context and research context. © 2017: Darrin F.

This study evaluated potential differences in character identification and interaction in a gaming context affording various character materialities: the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons. Multimethod analysis of online survey data (N = 1,135) reveals that character identification and interaction dimensions were invariant across primary character-representation mode (figurine, physical image, digital image, written, and imagined); however, post-hoc analysis suggests that multimaterial assemblages and social factors are key in how character representations are linked to character relations. Following, we argue that game characters may be more appropriately understood as subjective experiences rather than varying according to a given digital or physical manifestation.",

		"abstract": "Emotional creativity (EC) is a pattern of cognitive abilities and personality traits related to originality and appropriateness in emotional experience. EC has been found to be related to various constructs across different fields of psychology during the past 30 years, but a comprehensive examination of previous research is still lacking. The goal of this review is to explore the reliability of use of the Emotional Creativity Inventory (ECI) across studies, to test gender differences and to compare levels of EC in different countries. Thirty-five empirical studies focused on EC were retrieved and the coefficients required for the meta-analysis extracted. The meta-analysis revealed that women showed significantly higher EC than men (total N = 3,555). The same gender differences were also found when testing scores from three ECI subscales, i.e. emotional novelty, emotional preparedness and emotional effectiveness/authenticity. When comparing EC in 10 different countries (total N = 4,375), several cross-cultural differences were revealed. The Chinese sample showed a significantly lower average ECI total score than all the other countries. Based on the integration of results, the avenues for future research on EC and the breadth of influence of the concept of EC across different fields of psychology are discussed.",

		"abstract": "L’expérience ludique est souvent évoquée comme étant la raison de jouer à un jeu. En ce sens, elle est centrale aux réflexions du designer de jeu dont le travail doit, au mieux, aider le joueur à atteindre l’expérience visée par le jeu. Malheureusement, à l’heure actuelle, aucune approche connue de design ne permet au designer d’agir sur cette expérience de manière volontaire et concrète. En nous intéressant à la philosophie de l’action, qui nous permet de ramener l’expérience à l’action puis au raisonnement, nous sommes partis à la recherche d’une approche qui nous permettrait d’influencer les désirs, les connaissances et les croyances du joueur, dans le but d’agir directement sur son raisonnement. \nEn suivant la piste du design persuasif déjà tracée par d’autres auteurs en design, nous avons opté pour une approche basée sur le Traité de l’argumentation. Cette approche a été bâtie sur la traduction des principaux concepts de l’argumentation. Ensuite, en nous intéressant aux écrits en recherche par le design, nous avons mis ladite approche à l’épreuve à travers la création d’un jeu de rôle de table et des tests utilisateur. Le design et les tests utilisateur nous ont permis de recueillir — à travers un journal de bord, l’observation directe des participants, et des groupes de discussion — des données pour affiner le modèle théorique de l’approche. \nL’expérimentation a révélé qu’un design persuasif permettrait bel et bien d’influencer les désirs, les connaissances et les croyances des joueurs, mais que la discussion dépasse le lien causal de la mécanique de jeu vers l’expérience visée. En effet, le designer pourra user de plusieurs outils rhétoriques à travers les attributs du jeu pour mener le joueur vers son épanouissement. Malgré tout, ces outils ne sont que des tremplins utilisés pour amener le joueur à travers plusieurs étapes et comportements qu’il posera de lui-même. \nCette thèse discutera spécifiquement du design persuasif appliqué à la conception d’un jeu de rôle, et pourra, à l’avenir, grandir dans un programme de recherche qui viserait le design persuasif au sens large.",

		"abstract": "Objective: Role-playing games elicit narratives of heroism, mastery and agency. These are factors considered to promote mental health recovery. This study investigates whatthemes emerge from the stories of role-playing game players in recovery from mental health difficulty and how their stories reflect existing models of mental health recovery.Method: This study utilised narrative inquiry to understand the experiences of Dungeons and Dragon players in recovery from mental health difficulties. Thirteen Dungeons & Dragonsplayers (M = 33.31; SD = 10.05) were interviewed about their experience with the game and recovery. Analysis of narratives was conducted inductively and deductively.Result: Participants discussed a number of factors that linked Dungeons & Dragons to their mental health wellbeing. These included a) experiencing through characters, b) skill building, c) finding space from mental health symptoms, d) safely engaging with mental health difficulties, and e) building relationships. All five stages of the Psychological Recovery Model (Andresen, Oades & Caputi, 2003) were present, and participants engaged with Dungeons & Dragons in a manner reflective of their mental health recovery process. Conclusion The current study expands on research that conceptualizes recovery asa multidimensional process and highlights new elements that have implications for consumers and theoretical frameworks.KEY POINTSWhat is already known about this topic:(1) Mental health difficulties can severely impact a person’s quality of life and disrupt their internal narrative.(2) Mental health difficulties can severely impact a person’s quality of life and disrupt their internal narrative.(3) Community based activities can foster a sense of growth, self-mastery and agency that may ultimately lead to identity reconstruction and a sense of personal recovery.(4) Role-playing games have been identified as potentially helpful in assisting people with mental health difficulties restore a sense of agency and positive identity.What this topic adds:(1) Australian Dungeon and Dragon (D&D) players with a history of mental health difficulties were interviewed in regards to their experiences of role-playing and their mental health recovery.(2) Participants reported D&D assisted with building relationships with other players, experiencing emotions through their character, developing adaptive skills, engaging with difficult mental health topics and experiencing a safe space from mental health difficulties.(3) All five stages of the Psychological Recovery Model were present, and participants engaged with D&D in a manner reflective of their mental health recovery process.",

Specifically this study asked: In what ways do fantasy play and participation in the role-playing community benefit participants? This study aimed to address the lack of social work literature regarding the emotional and social benefits that roleplaying games provide consumers. Data were collected from interviews with six individuals who regularly engage in tabletop role-playing games. The study asked open ended questions regarding participants' experiences with the role-playing community, thematic and emotional content experienced within the fantasy setting, and benefits participants felt they'd gained from role-playing games and access to that community. The key findings of this study were that community access and feelings of belonging were an important part of the role-playing experience, that participants reported the context of fantasy play decreased their social anxiety which allowed them to interact with their own emotional content meaningful ways, and that role experimentation through their characters led to improved social skills in all participants.",

		"abstract": "In this study we explore how participation in tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) fosters experiences of social insertion in adolescence and adulthood. We conducted semi-directed interviews with nine participants who identified themselves as having used such practices to overcome difficult and challenging life experiences. We look at how participants interpreted their play experiences, described by some as “therapeutic.” Through TTRPGs, players were able to explore and better understand aspects of themselves, explore new interactions, and “test” new ways of expressing themselves. Additionally, participants were able to develop their interpersonal skills by participating in such practices, namely because of the roleplaying element. Participants stated that these practices and their therapeutic qualities also had positive effects on their lives outside of the game, helping them to enter and engage in various social situations that they previously felt excluded from, or hesitant to participate in. We argue that social interventions could invest in these types of cultural practices, embedded in popular culture, to encourage and facilitate participation of adolescents and adults in mental health services.&#x0D;",

		"abstract": "In game studies, meaningful play is commonly discussed and situated through Salen and Zimmerman’s (2004) definition describing it as the integrated and discernible relationship between player actions and system outcomes within the context of the game. However, this overlooks other ways that play can be meaningful. Based on observation and interviews with 20 Australian players, this article examines experiences with death in the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). In the context of meaningful play (Salen & Zimmerman, 2004) and positive negative experiences (Hopeametsä, 2008), we discuss (1) the impact of shared physical and social realities on death in D&D, (2) the design of death in D&D, and (3) how death in D&D shapes the future play and lives of players. From this, we argue that play can have meaning that transcends game boundaries, subsequently proposing the concept of “pivotal play” to describe appealing, memorable, and transformative play experiences.",

The game itself offers a multitude of personal and social benefits to all players involved, which may enrich their lives long after they have left the table. It provides socialization and recreational enjoyment, improves role negotiation and impression management, allows players to experience elements that are beyond their reality, creates a safe space to test new elements of identity, promotes creative problem solving and builds critical thinking. Gaming is an environment where these skills can be tested and explored with minimal risk. I argue in this thesis that it can and should be used in a therapeutic setting.",

		"abstract": "Many tabletop RPG players believe that gamemasters – the persons controlling the storyworld of a role-playing game – have a huge amount of responsibility on handling the issues rising within the communities and the problems coming up during play. What are the types of problems that gamemasters face while running games? How do they handle these problems when they do arise? This research set out to answer these questions by applying thematic analysis on a data set collected from 41 Vampire TRPG gamemasters with an online questionnaire.  \n \nThe results show that there are many types of problems that a gamemaster can face while running their game, including differences in creative agendas; difficult social dynamics; problems in power sharing and problems with bleed – the crossover between character and player. It is also presented that gamemasters use multiple tactics to ensure a safer and more enjoyable game for all participants. These included calibrations, which could be related to the exogenous, endogenous or diegetic frames of the game; directing, which focused on the the diegetic frame of the game and aftercare, which was used to prevent problems in social dynamics after the game, and to facilitate the changing of frames between game and “real life.”   \n \nI argue that while gamemasters do have a rather comprehensive understanding of safety, consent and boundary setting, a deeper understanding on the cultural issues affecting the gendered nature of power, emotions and bleed is required, as well as studies on the experiences of players. I also point out that there is indeed a small minority of tabletop gamers that still appear to feel threatened by safety mechanics and by studies such as this.",

		"abstract": "The purpose of this study was to understand the lived experiences of individuals who actively play fantasy tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). There is limited research on the lived gaming experience of individuals who play fantasy tabletop role-playing games in live gameplay. Fittingly, the current study utilized a qualitative heuristic research design based on Moustakas’s Heuristic Research Design, Methodology, and Application (1990). This study included five participants (referred to as co-researchers) over the age of 21 who actively participate in fantasy tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) or who have participated in TTRPGs, such as Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), within the last year of the study. Five primary themes were identified that spoke to the collective experience of playing TTRPGs: (a) introduction to TTRPGs and first time playing TTRPGs, (b) participants play TTRPGs because it is social, (c) participants get personal benefits from playing TTRPGs, (d) playing these types of games is a large commitment for participants, and (e) creating stories together. The data gathered in the study were examined with previously completed research in the area of TTRPGs and role-playing games. This study identified and discussed limitations such as researcher bias, time dedicated to a qualitative study, and the total number of participants. Recommendations for future research include exploring levels of experience of TTRPGs players, generalizability with gender, and a suggestion for a mixed-method study to explore further the areas that are limited in qualitative studies.",

		"abstract": "A paper developing insights regarding gaming, the concepts of indigeneity and settler colonialism, artistic appropriation, and the field of psychotherapy. The writer engages in an intensive and sustained analysis of the psychic material (including dreams and active imagination) that emerges in relation to engagement with the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition (Wizards of the Coast, 2014). The approach is phenomenological, and grounded in the psychology of C. G. Jung. The concepts of settler colonialism and indigeneity, discussed in response to the emergent psychic content, are explored in relation to one another as well as to gaming. Through the work’s continual reflexive turn toward its own content, insights are gained about the nature of gaming and the gamer’s psyche. As an offer toward the understanding of compulsive gaming-related psychiatric disorders (World Health Organization, 2018; American Psychiatric Association, 2013), it is suggested that a key danger of compulsive gaming may be its illusion of safety, providing a sense of potency, agency, and immersion in a magic circle (Huizinga, 1955) that is apart from reality. A multilayered understanding of the relationship between settler consciousness and indigeneity is developed. It is discovered that, in circumstances where imposing Indigenous values on an individual contravenes that individual’s genuine nature, this imposition can itself be a colonial act.",

This literature review provides a brief overview of basic RPG terminology, styles, and similarities to psychodrama and theater. It also demonstrates a basic analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of four TTRPGs and LARPs as therapeutic tools through the lens of drama therapy. This literature review is in service of future research into the application of drama therapy practices to role-playing gaming, as well as into clinical game design based in therapeutic goals and structure.",

		"abstract": "Le jeu de rôle sur table, créé dans les années 1970, est primitivement une activité de loisir. Cependant, nous avons pu relever de nombreuses similitudes avec une psychothérapie, sans même qu’il ne soit nécessaire de modifier cette activité. Ce travail entreprend donc d’explorer au-delà de ces premières constatations, et vise à tester cette théorie d’abord par la lecture et la comparaison de la bibliographie, puis de manière exploratoire sous forme d’une activité thérapeutique. Dans sa première partie, cette thèse présente ce qu’est le jeu de rôle sur table (ou papier) moderne. Elle présente notamment les bases de son rapprochement avec les psychothérapies. Dans sa deuxième partie, elle explorera l’essence-même des psychothérapies, à commencer par ce qui fait l’efficacité et la nature d’une psychothérapie. Ensuite, elle cherchera toutes les formes psychothérapeutiques qui sont à rapprocher du jeu de rôle, au premier rang desquelles la narrative therapy. Enfin, cette partie fera le lien entre jeu de rôle sur table et psychothérapie, de manière théorique et pratique (en mettant en avant les utilisations qui existent déjà du jeu de rôle, et même du jeu de rôle sur table). La troisième partie présentera notre approche exploratoire. Elle présentera d’abord la méthode générale de notre approche, avant de s’attarder sur les sept patients qui ont participé à une activité thérapeutique sous forme de jeu de rôle. Ce travail sur la place psychothérapeutique potentielle du jeu de rôle sur table pose (ou repose) les jalons d’une voie peu explorée, à ce jour éparpillée dans une littérature peu connue, mais dont les premiers résultats sont très encourageants; mais questionne également sur la nature de ce qu’est la psychothérapie, à une époque où le nombre d’écoles et de techniques est à son paroxysme.",

		"abstract": "Gary Alan Fine analyse l’influence de la disponibilité de ressources collectives sur l’organisation d’activités de loisir. Il distingue trois principaux types de ressources : les connaissances, la sociabilité et les symboles identitaires. Ces ressources apparemment intangibles peuvent toutefois comprendre une dimension matérielle, comme l’accès à des lieux de pratique ou de réunion, des moyens de financement et de communication, ou la possibilité pour les membres de coordonner leur présence physique. Les organisations utilisent cette dimension matérielle pour contrôler l’accès aux ressources. Pour appréhender les modes d’organisation de loisirs sous cet angle, Fine mobilise trois enquêtes ethnographiques : sur Donjons et Dragons, l’un des premiers jeux de rôle commerciaux créé dans les années 1970; sur les championnats de baseball de la Little League; et sur les cueilleurs de champignons engagés dans des associations. Selon Fine, pour qu’un loisir puisse être apprécié, il est nécessaire que des ressources soient mises à disposition afin que chaque membre ait les moyens de tirer satisfaction de son engagement volontaire. Pour se démarquer de l’étude des motivations des participants, privilégiées par la psychologie sociale, Fine souligne le rôle de ressources matérielles dans les conduites étudiées. Le cas du jeu de rôle Donjons et Dragons illustre un format différent des deux autres : celui de l’organisation commerciale. Cette organisation engendre des «sous-cultures propriétaires» (Dayan, 1986), c’est-à-dire des pratiques de loisir fortement contraintes par les ressources commerciales mises à disposition des participants (manuels de règles officielles, supports de jeu, etc.). L’imposition de ressources commerciales dont l’usage est contraint par des licences légales contrôlées par l’entreprise instaure un rapport de pouvoir asymétrique en défaveur des usagers, freinant l’accès aux ressources.

		"abstract": "Despite the tendency to think of leisure activity in terms of personal preferences, leisure can also be understood in terms of the ability of organizations to provide resources for participants. Drawing on the resource mobilization approach to social movements, I outline a theoretical approach, labeled Provisioning Theory, which attempts to explain how leisure organizations use resources to attract and retain participants. Organizations must mobilize “fun” for members if they are to continue over time and the leisure activity is to increase in popularity. After describing how Provisioning Theory applies to a voluntary subculture (mushroom collecting), I examine two special cases of the provisioning of resources: games that are “owned” or controlled by a corporation (Dungeons & Dragons) and voluntary sports activities organized with multiple levels of authority (Little League baseball).",

À ce niveau, on peut voir comment les sens des histoires sont construits et dans quelle mesure ils sont partagés ou communs. Le but de l’étude est de mettre au jour les processus par lesquels le jeu donne forme au groupe de pairs. Elle montre que les ressources spécifiques trouvées dans le jeu contribuent à élaborer des procédures égalitaires. Et cherche à analyser la rupture des mécanismes qui permettaient de maintenir un équilibre entre les membres du groupe.

		"abstract": "This study was a critical, archetypal, feminist ethnography and psychological inquiry into the experiences of women in tabletop role-playing gaming and its culture. Informed by performance ethnographic practice and the spirit of these games, it is written as an adventurous journey into and encounter with these experiences based on participant observation, interviews with gaming professionals, an online questionnaire of 428 gamers, and series of interviews with female gamers.\nEthnographically, this study documents the history and experiences of women in the culture of gaming. It presents profiles of a diversity of female gainers and explores historically the ways that women have established themselves as members of this culture and shaped this traditionally male dominated hobby. It also examines a multiplicity of opinions about and experiences of sexism, prejudice, and discrimination of women in gaming. While demonstrating the progress in the games and their culture to become more inclusive and welcoming to women, it shows there is still far to go. It also demonstrates how, despite the possibility and creative potential for gaming and its culture to imagine completely new social worlds, the same power dynamics and social structures are recreated in the games, groups, and culture.\nPsychologically, the study uses archetypal, relational, and pluralistic models of the self to demonstrate the complex imaginal relationship between self and character and the notion that role-playing games can be transformational liminoid spaces. The study explored the multiplicity of three participants, through a series of interviews, one series with the player, one interacting with each participant in role as one of their characters, and then a final series reflecting on the experience of the two previous interviews, the process, and the themes that were discussed. These interviews demonstrate three different relationships between self and character, as well as the ways that those imaginal relationships have impacted the lives of these women in powerful ways that reach beyond just fun and games.",

		"abstract": "A study of rhetorical practice in the design and interpretation of games, this dissertation draws on culture theory and ethnographic interviews to comprehend invention as a social act. Although only role-playing games written in English are considered, the approach taken to understand the structures of attention emergent in gaming is generalizable as a means of investigating the informal social and rhetorical aspects of other kinds of games. The textual and visual rhetorics of numerous games are examined as self-situating lessons for acquiring and focusing interest. The intrinsic gap between reading and following a rule is explored as a phenomenon mediated by rhetoric. Experienced players' reflections on styles and motives are translated into ratios in a grammar of rhetorical invention. Finally, the game designers are interviewed for their professional life histories relative to the development of particular games, and the matters they emphasize are read as configurations of cultural knowledge animated by personal rhetorical resources and heuristics.",

The media and conservative religious groups have largely perpetuated the stigma associated with this subculture.  This study takes a closer look at the stigma as seen from non-members and members of the sub-culture.  By introducing non-members to the culture we can see how their negative preconceptions changed to a greater amount of acceptance.  I found that with introduction, the negative image of role-playing games was reversed. Additionally I looked at the perceptions of experienced gamers and found that the group interaction is seen as the greatest benefit of being part of the sub-culture.",

Often, these worlds and these characters are based, either consciously or unconsciously , on mythic or legendary themes. Roleplaying is, along with religious services and campfire ghost stories, the closest this society comes to storytelling in the sense of a few people clustered around the fire swapping stories. Roleplaying has also evolved its own special set of superstitions, myths, and folklore.

		"abstract": "Since tabletop fantasy role-playing games emerged in the 1970s, fantasy gaming has made a unique contribution to popular culture and perceptions of social realities in America and around the world. This contribution is increasingly apparent as the gaming industry has diversified with the addition of collectible strategy games and other innovative products, as well as the recent advancements in videogame technology.\n   This book presents the most current research in fantasy games and examines the cultural and constructionist dimensions of fantasy gaming as a leisure activity. Each chapter investigates some social or behavioral aspect of fantasy gaming and provides insight into the cultural, linguistic, sociological, and psychological impact of games on both the individual and society. Section I discusses the intersection of fantasy and real-world scenarios and how the construction of a fantasy world is dialectically related to the construction of a gamer's social reality. Because the basic premise of fantasy gaming is the assumption of virtual identities, Section II looks at the relationship between gaming and various aspects of identity. The third and final section examines what the personal experiences of gamers can tell us about how humans experience reality.",

Simulation gaming is now well established as a legitimate academic pursuit and teaching tool. Simultaneous with the growth of educational games, the 1970s witnessed the development and popularity of other role-playing games, essentially simulations, which have enjoyment and fantasy as their major goals. \nThese games are known generically as fantasy role-playing games. My intent in this article is to describe the games, discuss the relationship of these games to similar activities (including educational simulations), describe the players, and examine their reasons for participating in this social world. By studying these play forms, researchers who specialize in educational simulations can observe parallels in this leisure activity.",

		"abstract": "Argues that humor in social interaction plays an important role in shaping identities and in structuring situational definitions. Three features of jocular interaction are of particular relevance for understanding humor's position in communication: (1) Humorous interaction demands an immediate response from its listeners. (2) Humorous interaction typically allows its animator considerable role distance, so that the implications of a jocular remark can be denied. (3) Humorous interaction as a metaphorical construction contains dense layers of meaning, and these meanings give it a significance beyond its denotative import. These 3 components permit an examination of how social actors strategically employ humor in natural interaction to altercast others (and define themselves) and to redefine situations. This analysis is illustrated by data from a gossip session among 3 teenage females and data from a participant observation study of fantasy game players. It is concluded that the realization of humor as a technique by which identities and situations are negotiated shows that this topic is of primary interest to students of social interaction.

		"abstract": "In fantasy role-playing games, participants collectively create and play fantasy personas in an imaginary universe by using a vast system of rules that function as guidelines for make-believe action and interaction. Consequently, role-playing games obligate participants to occupy a liminal role located in the boundaries of persona, player, and person. This study, based on approximately ninety hours of participant observation and forty interviews with thirty role-players, explores how role-players actively negotiate these symbolic boundaries: how role-players carve out distinct spheres of meaning between themselves, their fantasy personas, and status as players of these games. It also illustrates how these distinctions fail. Boundaries erupt and role-players prove unable to compartmentalize themselves so discretely. Through the lens of these games, we can examine simplified and exaggerated dynamics and entertain the possibility that we are all players located at the liminal margins between the people we believe ourselves to be and the personas we perform in situated social encounters.",

Elle repose sur la levée des contraintes de preuve : par recoupement pour les fictions mimétiques (roman, film. . . ), par isomorphisme pour les univers axiomatiques (jeu d'échecs, Tetris. . . ). Entre ces deux pôles apparaît une famille méconnue : les jeux de simulation, qui lient la visée mimétique (le monde à simuler) à un dispositif logicomathématique (le simulateur).",

		"abstract": "Since at least the 1970s, social theorists have been increasingly interested in the complex issues surrounding the construction of space and place in human activity.  Whereas previously “space was treated as static, neutral, transparent, and hence theoretically uninteresting,” many theorists have begun to explore the constructed nature of both space and place, the relationship between the two, and the relationship of both to issues of power and identity (Feld and Basso 1996; Lefebvre 1976; Soja 1980; Tuan 1977).  It is perhaps ironic that in game studies, where the spaces are more obviously constructed, little seems to have been written about the ways and ends to which players create and sustain imaginary spaces.  In this paper I explore the creation of space in Dungeons & Dragons, a case study I consider in the context of Gabbert's (2007) study of McCall, Iowa and Basso's (1996) study of the Western Apache.  Aligning these three studies allows each of them to nuance and illuminate one another, creating a complex picture of the human experience of space and place.",

		"abstract": "Identity Performativity theory is relatively new to the field of linguistics and as such has been the subject of a growing number of research in linguistics. Most popularly, focus on performativity has been the discursive construction of gendered identity/identities. Though a number of studies have sought to examine the role language performance plays in construction, a surprising few have aimed to look at activities focused on the intentional creation and maintenance of identities in a specifically performative context such as: improvisational acting and roleplaying games. This study uses a social constructionist framework through discourse analysis to examine a community of practice centered around the performance of multiple roles during a 9 hour session of Dungeons and Dragons, a tabletop roleplaying game, in order to see what strategies players employed to call out specific gendered roles and what those strategies might assume about identity construction. Primarily, how does language choice illustrate the theory that identity is not only co-constructed, but that each person embodies a series of sometimes conflicting gender identities that are often contested? The results of the research show evidence that each person constructs for themselves and others not one, but multiple, identities in the course of conversation and often for different purposes.",

The first chapter applies Henry Jenkins's theory of textual poaching to the authors' and cast's reappropriation of cultural narratives about female vampires. The chapter goes on to survey the narrative, cinematic and critical work on women as vampires. As many of the texts were developed as part of the fantasy role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade , this chapter also surveys how fantasy role-playing develops unpublished texts that can make fruitful ground for performance studies. The second chapter examines the rehearsal and production process in comparison to the work of Glenda Dickerson and other feminist directors.",

		"abstract": "Tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs) provide a unique religious experience to players through three levels of interaction. Players engage with religion and religious concepts in TRPGs through mechanics and system rules, setting, and interpersonal interactions with other gamers during the game session. Together these three facets of the TRPG experience create a bridge between the player and the game environment. This allows for players to experience the game setting as part of their conventional reality. Religious constructs erected in the game world and interacted with via the player's character, become authentic expressions of religion worthy of study by scholars of religion. Religion becomes actualized by the player as he translates the experience of his character into personal experience with the game environment. Mechanics help facilitate that translation by creating the liminal space of the game. Rules and system create boundaries for the game that creates the place where religious play can occur. setting then fills the liminal space providing the environment that is explored, creating an understandable engagement with religious components of the game. Lastly, the act of play, by the player, creates religious belief within the setting. Taken together the game experience of the TRPG is actuated to conventional religious experience, which opens it up as a subject for religious study.",

		"abstract": "This article argues for a distinctive form of participant observation which I label peopled ethnography. I contrast this to two alternative ethnographic approaches, the personal ethnography and the postulated ethnography. In a peopled ethnography the text is neither descriptive narrative nor conceptual theory; rather, the understanding of the setting and its theoretical implications are grounded in a set of detailed vignettes, based on field notes, interview extracts, and the texts that group members produce. The detailed account, coupled with the ability of the reader to generalize from the setting, is at the heart of this methodological perspective. This form of ethnography is most effectively based on the observation of an interacting group, a setting in which one can explore the organized routines of behavior. I demonstrate the use of peopled ethnography through my own ethnographic investigations, contrasting this approach with classic works from other approaches.",

		"abstract": "What makes Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) unique among games is the way it merges storytelling with game mechanics. Before the invention of D&D, both acting/narrative-based games and strategy-based war games that made use of fantasy-genre elements existed, but the way D&D integrates both elements invented a whole new category of game, one in which the immersive draw of a plot proves just as important as good tactics or luck of the dice. This chapter explores the relationship between the qualitative and quantitative aspects of D&D. Specifically, it argues that the rules of the game provide quantitative corollaries to aspects of storytelling that we traditionally think of as qualitative: character, morality, personal development, etc. These quantitative components, however, serve a far greater function than merely providing a measurable foundation on which to base dice rolls: More than the fantastic creatures and the magic spells in the game, quantification is perhaps the D&D's greatest fantasy. Through such quantification, the game is able to provide its players with an unshakeable moral order, a numerical measure of normally intangible personal attributes (such as intelligence), and a running total of a character's growth and success as a \"person.\" The purpose of all of this accountancy is to satisfy the very deep desire for a world of known quantities and calculable success, which in turn allows for a sense of achievement that is difficult to match in a complex, qualitative world. With such foci, the author of this chapter raises questions about the influence of Dungeons and Dragons on its successors while also providing insight into its continued popularity. With online games' (Asheron's Call, EverQuest) obvious debt to Dungeons and Dragons, such a study is especially timely.",

It begins by relating Alasdair MacIntyre’s notion of tradition to his earlier analysis of ideology and to the notion of ideology ingeneral. The paper then tackles two dominant forms of ideology – Commodity Fetishism and Scientism – and shows how both Eucharist and Dungeons and Dragons promote critical thinking to resist those ideologies. In the process, it denies the Althusserian-Foucauldian analysis of ideology as mere materialityand defends a conception of ideology as material and ideal.",

However, geek culture is becoming increasingly mainstream; for example, in the past year alone, Dragon*Con, a major Geek convention in Atlanta, Georgia, attracted an attendance of over 57,000 members. The present article uses an individual differences approach to examine three theoretical accounts of geek culture. Seven studies (N = 2354) develop the Geek Culture Engagement Scale (GCES) to quantify geek engagement and assess its relationships to theoretically relevant personality and individual differences variables. These studies present evidence that individuals may engage in geek culture in order to maintain narcissistic self-views (the great fantasy migration hypothesis), to fulfill belongingness needs (the belongingness hypothesis), and to satisfy needs for creative expression (the need for engagement hypothesis). Geek engagement is found to be associated with elevated grandiose narcissism, extraversion, openness to experience, depression, and subjective well-being across multiple samples. These data lay the groundwork for further exploration of geek culture as well as provide a foundation for examining other forms of subculture participation.",

		"abstract": "Permeated and referenced throughout popular culture, Dungeons & Dragons has become iconic as the cardinal and archetypal tabletop role-playing game. Participants have been drawn to D&D for over forty years, departing into imagined and collaborative fantasy worlds. This thesis is concerned with analysing current participatory practices in D&D, accounting for evolving styles of hybridised gaming and retentions of traditional tabletop play. It ventures beyond initial conceptual enquiries, developing tangible conclusions to the questions: “How important is the idea of community when playing Dungeons & Dragons ?” and “What is appealing about constructing fictitious identities within the group, actualised through notions of play? ” To assist in answering these questions an Internet survey was developed. Survey data is presented, analysed, and contrasted with existing role­playing game scholarship. Emergent findings discuss participant experiences of “entertainment” “fantasy”, “community”, and preferred “ D&D editions ”. It is strongly contended that D&D transcends the superficialities associated with a “game”. Participants powerfully engage — transmuting participatory experiences into broader realms of purpose and meaning. The game facilitates the continual formation and negotiation of community and identity, demonstrating its wider socio­cultural applicability. The ability and appeal to engage with substantial identity exploration is clearly observable within D&D practices. The game offers participants accessibility into divergent paradigms of reality. Participants’ playful explorations have a lasting effect in the “real world”. Finally, participants develop and enjoy a strong sense of community through their long-term gaming relationships. Regardless of whether these communities are enacted in “online” or “offline” spheres, these spaces endow participants with substantial benefits — belonging, acceptance, and a shared sense of “fun”.",

		"abstract": "A thesis presented on modern tabletop role-playing games and how they offer anthropologists a new way to approach issues of creativity, identity construction, social interaction, and the nature of play in American culture. In these games, players continuously challenge and redefine aspects of personal identity, social paradigms, gender identity, and reality construction. This thesis is exemplified by the interactions of two separate role-playing groups in Muncie, Indiana, as well as multiple interviews with gamers from many different areas. This idea is also clearly reflected in the interactions of role-players, both in their own personas and in character. Multiple layers of roles, in both the fictional world and within the social group of the players, are created, accepted, adapted, and discarded during the course of an average game. \nGamers’ voices are emphasized, rather than game play itself, in order to explore how gamers feel and think about their play. Both Ludology and Carnival are explored as possible ways to approach the subject. Play in general allows individuals and/or small groups the creative space to form new strategies to enact personal and cultural change in the reality outside of the game; while tabletop RPGs allow players the liminal space to explore different aspects of their personal identities, even as they create an outlet for challenging social strictures. Negative cultural labeling of these games as deviant and subversive has created the illusion of secrecy that helps the games to function in this manor. The importance of both play and narrative become obvious when speaking to gamers about their hobby; allowing the gamers to form a sub-culture based on the shared experiences of the games. And it is in these shared experiences that the gamers find the power to alter their real-life self images, and experiment with change.",

The most familiar surviving stories that connect us to our ancestors take the form of folklore and mythology. Games, too, have served many of the same functions as storytelling. In modern times, games and storytelling are no less prevalent, although the particular forms they take and functions they fulfill have been vastly expanded. Narrative gaming has become extremely popular, allowing for the consumption of both regional heritage and global multiculturalism. This essay will explore the roles of these contemporary narratives and provide an analysis of the transition from the traditional narrative to the live role-playing game.",

It can be viewed from multiple perspectives, for example, the time of the playing of the game or the flow of time in a game world. In this article, a comprehensive game time model based on empirical research as well as recent theory is presented. It proposes various perspectives on game time and integrates them to allow coherent representation of the same events in the different perspectives. The model has been tested across tabletop and digital formats, and its applicability across game formats is demonstrated. Emphasis is placed on multiplayer and massively multiplayer role-playing games because these feature complex game time behavior not previously evaluated. The model considers game time as an interactively created and nonlinear feature of games and game play.",

Während in Computerrollenspielen Avatare durch CGI-Umgebungen gesteuert werden, vollzieht sich die Handlung hier durch Beschreibung und ein Improvisationstheater-ähnliches Darstellen. Die diegetischen Wirklichkeiten sind dabei nicht nur inspiriert von verschiedensten Medien, Genres, und Epochen – sei es der »Herr der Ringe« oder die Heian-Zeit (794 – 1185) – sondern stehen in einem Spannungsverhältnis zu Praktiken und Kategorien, die entscheidend für die Herstellung und Aufrechterhaltung der ›normalen‹ Realität außerhalb des Spiels sind. Geschlecht und die Unterscheidung in Mann und Frau gehören zu derartigen Kategorien und damit verbundenen Praktiken. Wie verhält sich das doing gender am Spieltisch zu Geschlechterkategorien und -handlungen außerhalb des Spiels? Ist eine solche Trennung überhaupt möglich und sinnvoll ?\n\nMit Fokus auf Tischrollenspiele in Japan und basierend auf der Analyse von qualitativen Interviews und teilnehmender Beobachtung untersucht der vorliegende Beitrag Geschlecht als ›beiläufige Realität‹ (collateral reality), die in teilweise verbundenen, alltäglichen und spielerischen Kontexten ›getan‹ wird. Das Cross-Gender-Spiel von Rollenspielerinnen und -spielern eröffnet Einblicke in die Stabilisierung von Geschlechtergrenzen – beispielsweise durch geschlechtskonnotierte Sprache, die außerhalb des Spiels als überholt gelten mag, im Spiel jedoch Authentizität schafft – und macht dabei deutlich, dass keine singuläre Größe wie ›die japanische Gesellschaft‹ als Explanans fungieren kann, sondern dass Geschlecht in einem vernetzten und interdependenten Wechselverhältnis von Spiel und Wirklichkeit produziert wird.",

Aus wissenstypologischer und -soziologischer Perspektive fehlen bisher Ansätze, die uns diese Leistung verständlich machen können. Die hier vorgestellte explorative und hypothesen-generierende Studie untersucht die Weisen wie Wissen im Rollenspiel erzeugt, verwendet, verteilt und bewertet wird, und dadurch in die Konstruktion von Wirklichkeit und Fiktion in diesem Spiel eingeht – kurz: die Typen des in Rollenspielen vorkommenden Wissens. Die dafür relevanten Kategorien werden sowohl empirisch-induktiv aus qualitativen Interviews mit Rollenspielern wie auch theoretisch-deduktiv aus der bestehenden Forschungsliteratur über Rollenspiel gewonnen und in einer Proto-Theorie systematisiert. Gemäss dieser Proto-Theorie können die in Rollenspielen verwendeten Wissensinhalte unter den drei Wissens-Metatypen „Personen-Wissen“, „Rollenspieler-Wissen“ und „Charakter-Wissen“ subsumiert werden. Dies erlaubt es, das Interaktionsverhältnis formal verschiedener Wissensinhalte beim erforderlichen Aktivieren, Bewerten und Ausblenden dieses Wissens in dem komplexen Kommunikationsprozess, an dem die Teilnehmenden partizipieren, theoretisch zu erschliessen. Zudem lässt sich die Proto-Theorie empirisch anwenden, um die tatsächliche Interaktion im Rollenspiel zu analysieren und z.T. zu erklären. Diese Anwendung wird in der Studie exemplarisch anhand von transkribierten Tonband-Mitschnitten einer Rollenspielsitzung erfolgreich durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse der Studie legen nahe, dass bei dieser Interaktion ein eigentliches Wissensmanagement sowohl des Einzelnen als auch der ganzen Rollenspielergruppe erforderlich ist. Dabei spielen sowohl explizite wie auch implizite Regulierungen auf Basis zugesprochener und gewachsener Autorität und damit verbundener Legitimität des eingesetzten Wissens eine Rolle. Durch diese Aushandlungsprozesse werden zwei eigenständige Spielwirklichkeiten konstruiert – die soziale Wirklichkeit des Rollenspielens und die fiktive Wirklichkeit der Spielwelt –, die als Bezugsrahmen für sinnvolle Handlungen der Rollenspieler als Rollenspieler und als Charakter fungieren und mithin Rollenspielen überhaupt erst ermöglichen. Die in dieser Studie generierten Hypothesen dazu bilden mögliche Anknüpfungspunkte für weiterführende Forschung.",

		"abstract": "This paper focuses some aspects of the self – other process of knowledge construction, from the interpretive analysis of Role Playing Game situations. Our focus of analysis is mainly concerned with relationships between the subjective dimensions of desire and alterity, as opened by the participants’ symbolic actions addressed to the\nfuture. In such an extent, we looked for ruptures in the actors’ seek to intersubjective\nsharing, brought about their dialogical interactions. These ruptures were usually\naccompanied by the reorganization of the actors’ subjective experiences through symbolic resources. As a result, we propose an interpretive frame about the dynamic\nelements encompassed by the actor’s dialogical relationships. We could apprehend the presence of otherness in the symbolic configurations constructed by the I. In such an extent, we can say that the meaning of personal constructions were mainly addressed\nto the otherness, with whom the I tried to have a shared ground of meaning. This happens as part of the process of questioning for ways of symbolic transitions, facing\nthe ruptures brought about in the course of the I-other interaction itself.",

		"abstract": "The proposed thesis project will perform an inductive, qualitative micro-ethnography of tabletop role-playing games in at least three local contexts. The primary research method will be participant observations of these speech events over at least 100 hours of game play. Game sessions will be recorded in audio and video format so as to capture the full range of verbal and non-verbal artistry that accompanies role-playing generally. These recordings will be selectively transcribed. A web site will be constructed which will facilitate IRB and thesis committee monitoring as well as disseminate all findings. Guiding theory is arranged into the domains of Performance, Bricolage, Double-Voiced Discourse and Idioculture. I intend to challenge the idea that tabletop role-play involves a degenerative, limited type of performance. I want to explore the ways in which game participants use double-voiced discourse and strategies of persuasion during game events. I want to examine game structures such as adventures and character speech acts as if they were bricolage; are there patterns in the types of creative collages I will encounter? Considering the amount of context specific frames that role-players use and create during their games (Idioculture), my 18-year familiarity with role-playing games is an asset. This thesis project will not only extend an anthropological foothold into a relatively unexplored type of speech event, it will also significantly improve the existing body of theory which describes and explains role-playing games generally. Research will conclude with a public thesis defense in Fall 2005.",

Cocooning, funktionaler Analphabetismus und eine verarmte Vorstellungswelt werden zu einem Massenphänomen. Ein Zusammenhang mit der zunehmenden Virtualisierung des Alltags liegt nahe.

Tatsächlich existieren dagegen seit den 1970er Jahren Pen  & Paper-Rollenspiele, die abseits vom Mainstream ohne elektronische Hilfsmittel alleine durch Sprache und Vorstellungskraft durchgeführt werden. Diese phantasievollen Spiele wendeten schon konstruktivistische Methoden an, bevor diese von der interaktionistisch-konstruktivistischen Pädagogik entdeckt wurden. Dieses Phänomen wird erstmals aus der Sicht der Kunstpädagogik auf sein kreatives Potential hin untersucht. Dabei werden auch die Entwicklungsgeschichte, Aufbau und Genre der P  & P-Rollenspiele ausführlich dargestellt.",

		"abstract": "This volume explores the various social and psychological functions of role-playing, with a specific emphasis on role-playing games. I posit that the activity of role-playing finds its roots in essential aspects of human social behavior, including childhood pretend play, storytelling, and ritual. The subcultural practice of role-playing games emerged from these age-old practices, but also from several cultural shifts inherent to American life in the latter half of the twentieth century. These shifts include culture-wide paradigm shifts regarding diversity, religion, and alternative lifestyles; an increased interest in the fantasy, science fiction, and horror genres; the heightened sense of cynicism and self-awareness characteristic of Generation X; and the large-scale technological advances characteristic of the computer and information age.\n\nWhile these cultural shifts specifically contributed to the popularity of role-playing games as a subculture, people engage in the practice of role-playing in a variety of different contexts, including business, education, military training, improvisational theater, drama therapy, health care, and leisure. The practice of role-playing offers three basic functions. First, role-playing enhances a group‘s sense of communal cohesiveness by providing narrative enactment within a ritual framework. Second, role-playing often encourages complex problem-solving and provides participants with the opportunity to learn an extensive array of skills through the enactment of scenarios. Third, role-playing offers participants a safe space to enact alternate personas through a process known as identity alteration.\n\nThis volume explores these three concepts with regard to the various forms of role-playing. The study then offers a detailed, participant-observer ethnography involving extensive, qualitative interviews with nineteen respondents. I conclude that the benefits offered by role-playing in more traditional environments are also offered through the leisure activity of role-playing games. Though mainstream American media channels often dismisses involvement in role-playing games as escapist and potentially dangerous, this volume posits the notion that role-playing encourages creativity, self-awareness, empathy, group cohesion, and “out-of-the-box” thinking. The role-playing game platform facilitates the development of various cognitive and social skills that remain useful in the “real world.” Thus, participation in role-playing games should incur a lesser amount of stigma from the larger culture.",

Edgework, as defined by Stephen Lyng, occurs when people voluntarily tread boundaries to gain emotional rewards. Based on nineteen months of participant-observation in a gaming group, twenty in-depth interviews, and archival data from e-mail lists and websites, I show how gamers gained many of the benefits that traditional edgeworkers, like extreme sports participants, obtain without the physical danger. Participants tread the boundaries of sanity/insanity and order/disorder, prepared for their edgework, and sustained an illusion of control. By playing a game, they felt alive and powerful, yet removed the edge, thus engaging in “virtual edgework.” In contrast to previous studies, I show that what makes an activity edgework is not the type of risk but how the experience is structured. I suggest that future scholars need to consider new avenues for edgework as people’s lives move online.",

		"abstract": "Drawing on four years of participant observation, interviews, and game recordings, this dissertation explores the collaborative experience of imagined worlds in tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. Research on tabletop games has at times been myopic in terms of time depth and geographic scope, and has often obscured the ethnographic realities of gaming communities. This research expands the ethnographic record on tabletop role-playing games and uses a phenomenological approach to carefully examine how gamers at five sites across the United States structure their experience of imagined worlds in the context of a productive tension between enchantment and rationalization. \n\nAfter discussing the history of Dungeons & Dragons in terms of enchantment and rationalization, the dissertation presents three case studies, each exploring a different facet of experience in imagined worlds. At a convention in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, gamers commemorate the life of Dungeons & Dragons co-creator Gary Gygax, but also their own childhoods and a sense of a lost, imagined pre-modern world. The experience of time in the game connects that perduring world with the imagined world of the game. Having explored the relationships between commemoration, nostalgia, and the experience of imagined worlds, the dissertation moves on to consider how the imagined worlds of gaming enter the experience of players. The techniques and theories of performance utilized by a gamer in Denton, Texas portray performances in gaming, psychedelic rock, and abstract analog video art as \"kidnapping reality” through the use of color, song, and choice diction to convey both affect and imaginary things into the physical spaces of her performances. The final case study considers gamers in New York City and Portland, Connecticut, where two groups have developed the imaginary worlds of their games over many years. The dissertation argues that gamers in these groups come to experience the imagined world as increasingly concrete and complex over time, and that their sustained interactions with it develop into a strong sense of what Heidegger called dwelling.",

Although some research is available on communication in computer mediated role-playing games, little exists on communication practices in tabletop role-playing games. In my research, I reviewed existing scholarly literature on tabletop role-playing games, as well as theory on the role language plays in constructing reality. I conducted passive participant observation on a group of people playing Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. By applying theory to my ethnographic research, I demonstrated how players constructed a collective reality through communication. Players did this by demonstrating their own enthrallment with the game and by sharing a language code.",

		"abstract": "Using Johan Huizinga's concept of the magic circle as a context for understanding how sacred spaces reserved for play manifest within role-playing game (RPG) environments both digital and table-top, this dissertation argues that while certain elements of the magic circle are still present, the vast amount of work produced to monitor the boundaries of sacred game space stem from the intimate relationships between players. Online RPG environments are open to critique due to the seemingly wide-spread use of hostility as a gate-keeping tactic. Numerous studies and digital media scholars have examined how bullying, harassment, and bodily threats present within toxic digital gaming cultures act as a means of limiting access to participation. Because marginalized players, whether due to gender, race, or sexual identity, are often playing in gaming environments that get coded as toxic, this dissertation chooses to interrogate the ways in which some players negotiate game environments that are complicated at best and overtly hostile at worst. While the dissertation is careful to note the distinctions between online RPGs and offline table-top RPGs, the core argument made stems from the consistencies present between both: both the online and table-top groups who participated in the study use tools of intimacy both actively and passively as a means of fostering individual as well as group identity. In so doing, the use of intimacy acts as a buffer against hostile acts that would otherwise inhibit participation.\nBut this dissertation does not just attempt to understand how players weather and negotiate hostility outside of their gaming groups. It also seeks to understand how some players are able to absorb the hostility and redirect it as a creative play-style. In this case, \"playing ugly\" becomes a means of performance not directed outward, but rather, inward. Taboo play, in this case, becomes a cathartic way in which players process hostility by becoming hostile. While this play-style may seem to mirror the online toxic environments that can further separate marginalized players from a larger online gaming ecology, playing ugly strives to make its members immune to the aggression-although whether that achievement is attainable is tenuous.",

		"abstract": "This dissertation uses mythological studies, psychological ideas and sociological techniques to introduce the reader to the thesis that tabletop role-playing game (TRPG) characters are intricate, semi-independent personae of their players, who have the potential to be equal in influence to an individual’s other expressions of personality (e.g. employee, parent, friend, etc). TRPG characters, like all aspects of personality, exist at the junction of mythical, psychological, and sociological forces. Unlike other personae, TRPG characters exist within alternative realities deliberately crafted from heroic mythology, which feature group-centered behavior at their core.\nBy examining differences between character and player perspectives, especially the group based norm of heroism common across many kinds of TRPGs, the importance of studying TRPG characters as personae in their own right is emphasized. The dissertation concludes with ways for TRPG scholars to increase emphasis on TRPG character studies, and with ways for non-TRPG studies to benefit from an increased emphasis on personae play as an important aspect of psychosocial growth, especially with regard to how heroism is understood in American culture.",

		"abstract": "This thesis is a critical examination of how players of the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons use the concept of race, both in and out of the game. The study of race in role-playing games has been neglected, and this is a tragedy, because these games offer a unique space where the concept of race, often a difficult and uncomfortable topic of conversation, is questioned, criticized, and reshaped by the players. Role-playing games are spaces of encounter between the players and a cast of imaginary others, and this requires a degree of empathy on the part of the players that makes role-playing games a space of ideological change, as players are forced to consider the world from viewpoints both familiar and alien.\nThe theoretical framework within combines a phenomenological analysis of roleplaying games that allows non-gamers to understand the practice and importance of these games with critical race theorists such as bell hooks, Paul Gilroy, and Patricia Hill Collins that defines what race is and how it affects all of us on a day-to-day basis. This thesis is also based on interviews with geographically diverse set of gamers who demonstrate the highly personal nature of gaming, and how race takes on a multitude of meanings both within the fictional game settings and around the gaming table.",

It takes a historical approach that is grounded in Foucauldian genealogy, arguing that the cultures of masculinity in Dungeons & Dragons can be discursively traced through published manuals and articles about the game. Drawing on fan conversations found in The Dragon, it compares the representations of masculinity found in these historic texts to the ways that masculinity is represented today in the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons. In staging this comparison, it shows how depictions of masculinity have progressed over the 40-year life span of Dungeons & Dragons, but also how they have stayed the same.",

		"abstract": "Il est observable depuis quelques années des diffusions en streaming de parties de jeu de rôle sur table. Le streaming, tel que nous l’entendons en tant qu’activité culturelle, se distingue des autres formes de diffusion de contenus vidéo en ligne par son haut niveau d’interaction qui en fait un canal communicationnel plus complet. Ce dispositif permet notamment aux spectateurs d’interagir entre eux mais aussi parfois avec les créateurs de contenus, et ce, souvent en temps réel. Ce faisant, le streaming étend à une audience les cadres de participation ainsi que les plans de présence du jeu de rôle papier. En intégrant le spectateur dans l’action ludique de manière toujours plus interactive, le streaming redéfinit l’espace de jeu dont les frontières peuvent parfois devenir ténues et poreuses avec le hors-jeu. Finalement, les logiques du jeu de rôle sur table se voient fréquemment repensées pour répondre aux nouveaux enjeux médiatiques.",

Les actual plays répondent à des enjeux médiatiques qui se manifestent en termes d’auditoire, de notoriété et de divertissement. Des moyens conséquents sont alors mobilisés pour développer ces émissions afin de les rendre les plus attractives possibles pour les spectateurs comme pour les joueurs. Il apparaît cependant qu’aucune étude n’ait jamais formalisé ces moyens. L’objectif du présent travail est donc de faire ressortir les modalités de médiatisation et de spectatorisation des actual plays afin de les examiner et de voir si celles-ci font appel à une standardisation ou une fragmentation des pratiques. Pour ce faire, nous avons réalisé une analyse comparative exploratoire sur la base d’une grille d’analyse créée ad hoc. La comparaison semble dégager un modèle de pratiques standardisées dans les actual plays.",

Ce dernier est donc analysé comme une pratique ludique, sociale et créative qui est investie personnellement et collectivement par le corps et l’imagination des joueurs. Afin de présenter différentes manières de s’engager dans la fiction, je décris les façons dont les rôlistes conçoivent les univers fictionnels ludiques.

		"abstract": "This article is dedicated to the issue of achieving consensus in tabletop role-playing games and also addresses the question of how exactly play­ers gain power over the interpretation of events within a tabletop RPG. A tabletop role-playing game presupposes that its participants constantly articulate statements which shift the current configuration of in-game elements and also play the role of being artistic descriptions of said shifts. The alternation and interplay of performative and descriptive statements, their convolution and also the fact that, in tabletop RPGs, unlike in the majority of the rest of the games known to humanity, the same words from natural languages are used both in order to produce a shift in abstract, symbolic structure of a game, and to artistically describe said shift, all lead to the situation where participants cannot tell a proper symbolic system of a given game from other symbolic systems which this game refers to. In this article, we propose an analytical model of a tabletop RPG which would make it possible to draw stricter borderlines between a given RPG’s fictional world and its inner symbolic structure. Furthermore, it would allow us to formulate a clearer question regarding the structures of power produced while playing an RPG, and what exactly players gain control over while playing it. Moreover, this model would enable us to explore in detail the processes of the individual and collective interpretation of events in a tabletop RPG, and classify facts within said interpretation in relation to whether they are held to be objectively or subjectively true.",

		"abstract": "Tabletop role-playing games (TTRPG) have faced stigma since their inception in the 1970s, and this stigmatization persists to some degree today, arguing these games teach anti-social behaviours. On the other hand, academics have argued for the benefits of game play. These contradictory discourses have led to the question: What are the learning outcomes associated with tabletop role-playing? This study analyzed qualitative semi-directed interviews with nine individuals who have identified themselves as having experienced hardships on which TTRPGs have had a positive effect. Experiences identified by the participants included incarceration, social exclusion, gender transition and mental health-related challenges. It was found that all participants experienced, to varying degrees, social and societal isolation related to their hardships. However, TTRPGs had perceived benefits—for example, self-development, skill development and achievement—which went beyond the gaming context, and had an effect on different aspects of the participant’s lives. I argue that TTRPGs provided a context which acted as a liminal space, helping players transition away from social and societal isolation towards a form of social participation. This suggests that TTRPGs may help players engage in citizenship. This study expands on current RPG research, by looking at the actual experience of playing these games and the long-lasting impact they can have on players.",

		"abstract": "This researcher asks the question as to how an individual's identity development is affected by playing the game Dungeons & Dragons and similar tabletop roleplaying games, as well as asks ancillary questions related to questions of the interplay between the Characters participants create in game and their out of game persona’s, Escapism, the role of gender as well as the nature of reality, all within the context of the game Dungeons & Dragons. The researcher conducted a series of 8 interviews with participants whom he plays the game with in a number of organized game sessions both before and during the course of this research. The Researcher finds that effects to one's identity do not extend to the participants personalities, but are mainly focused on their behavioral and emotional development. The researcher also found that there was a spectrum of different types of characters created by players, ranging from those that were reflections or embodiments of certain aspects of their personality to create new identities or those who create completely new identities, much in line with research conducted by Sherry Turkle on this topic. The researcher also finds that the game can act as a means of gender empowerment should the participant take part in a game group that is encouraging in that manner. The researcher concludes by stating that while all effects to one's identity through playing Dungeons & Dragons would be dependant on a myriad of factors related to the game sessions that player participates in, noting that positive influences can be elicited through gameplay dependant on the nature of the game group. All in all the researcher notes that there is a myriad of avenues for further research within this topic.",

		"abstract": "First created in 1974, the largest table-top role-playing game (RPG) Dungeons &\nDragons (D&D) started out as a war game where multiple players could join in and fight\nmonsters. Grounded in fantasy conventions and as a way to explore fantasy genres,\nDungeons & Dragons popularity continued through new editions and add-ons. In\naddition, Dungeons & Dragons legacy has lived on in the gaming world as the father of\nmost RPGs and fantasy games with a large fan following across various editions and over\nmultiple decades. The fan following is still evident today due to D&D’s foundations in\nhigh fantasy. An exploration of the ways in which fantasy narrative plays a role in the fan\nculture of D&D is necessary to understand how the aspects of fantasy affect gameplay\nand how players view D&D. By conducting a study of Dungeons & Dragons players\nwhich focused on close game play, players’ relationships to other fantasy genres, and\nhow players interacted with game conventions, I explored the ways in which Dungeons &\nDragons introduced players to fantasy and how they participated in a fandom. This paper\nwill present the findings of the study as well as situate Dungeons & Dragons in\nrelationship to other fantasy and gaming subcultures.",

		"abstract": "Dungeons & Dragons is a popular tabletop roleplaying game, a genre in which players\nengage in logical, shared, structured fantasy predicated on certain fictional assumptions (Fine,\n2002, p. 12). Dungeons & Dragons is a collaborative and highly social activity, therefore\nrequiring significant social investment and engagement by each member of the community\n(Adams, 2013, p. 77). Adams (2013) furthermore concluded that the game served as a “vehicle\nfor players to consistently make an effort to socialize in structured ways” (p. 77). However,\nthese communities continue to be associated with social ineptitude and further stigmatized by\nassociation with psychiatric disorders (Lis, Chiniara, Biskin & Montoro, 2015, p. 381-382).\nI was introduced to a Dungeons & Dragons community by a mutual friend. After an initial\nobservation of several hours, I conducted preliminary interviews with both leaders (Dungeon\nMasters), in succession. Afterwards, I conducted a follow-up interview with just one of the\nleaders. This paper demonstrates the relationship between shared fantasy and collaborative\nconsensus building, but pays particular attention to the unique jargon and conversational style\nof the community. I construct several taxonomies through thematic analysis, exploring the\nstrategies gamers use to construct shared fantasy, and a shared repertoire based on crossmedia references, politics, and the history of the game. This paper furthermore analyzes the\nrole of report-talk, a typically masculine conversational style that uses the exchange of\ninformation as a means by which to compete for and communicate status (Tannen 1991). I\nexplore how these values and styles serve to alienate women and impede female participation.",

		"abstract": "The most recent edition of tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) has gained much popularity. This is often contributed to the presence of D&D in popular media and of players live-streaming their D&D game online. This form of live-streaming has also garnered popularity online. D&D publisher Wizards of the Coast has also started their own official D&D streaming channel on the platform Twitch. This paper examines the relationship between these official streams and the game itself through the lenses of paratext and transmedia. This allows insight into how these streams extend the game into a new medium and illustrates how these streams can influence the perceptions of the viewer on the game. These aspects in the streams will be examined in order to argue that Wizards of the Coast’s move to regularly live-stream Dungeons and Dragons sessions compliments the transmedia aspect of Dungeons and Dragons as a franchise.",

Being a game played through an extended series of\nperformative utterances, researchers are able to observe the expression, experimentation, and\nexploration of identities as a negotiated process among players. Of particular interest are the\nexpression of identities that may be marginalized and thus closeted by bearers. For TRPG\nplayers with stigmatized identities, the game serves as a back-channel function for enacting\nthese identity performances. This study found that players used the game to experiment with,\nexpress, and explore through a confluence of validating communication to facilitate authentic\nor sincere play. As a result, players more fully immersed themselves in the narrative\nexperience which was used to integrate underdeveloped facets of identity into their primary\nidentity. These findings support the forwarding of theoretical and material contributions that\ncommunication scholars can find by studying TRPG spaces, particularly those used by\npeople with marginalized identities.",

		"abstract": "“Queer Play: Facilitating Explorations of Gender and Sexuality in Role Playing Games” was a UREAP research project that I undertook between April and September 2016 in which I investigated the potential for digital and analog roleplaying games to be used as tools to encourage players to embody characters with alternative identities. As part of this process, I developed my own tabletop role playing game, Vestige, to test these strategies with groups of players. The strategies I developed were synthesized from and inspired by existing role playing games, particularly those that are well known among queer gamers, though many lesser known games were reviewed as well. The investigation culminated with the implementation of an Affinities and Aversions system in Vestige, which encourages the player to play with shifting relationships and identities. As a result, even the most trope-based characters will undergo some sort of identity fluctuation through the process of extended play. The players, in turn, are given game space and even encouraged to explore gender and sexuality vicariously through the characters they create.",

		"abstract": "This participant observation study explored the underlying structural component of the tabletop fantasy game Dungeons & Dragons and examined how social order is maintained and functions in the face of social ambiguity and randomness. This study was conducted on a sample of 35 fantasy gamers within the North Bay, Ontario community. Field notes on 20 gameplay sessions were taken as well as transcriptions of conversational interviews and follow-up interviews with participants. Finding suggest that Dungeons & Dragons operates as a wispy community (Fine & Van den Scott, 2011) that demands social stratification and regulation due to the chance and ambiguity embedded within the game. In order to regulate shared fantasy, Game Masters had to engage in complex role negotiations and mechanisms of social repair. Findings indicate that for Dungeons & Dragons to operate to shared normative expectations, underlying trust and the preservation of the shared narrative must be socially upheld. A failure to maintain narrative-focused or for a Game Master to effectively navigate their social role causes players to engage in role-distancing behaviours or dismiss themselves from the wispy community completely. This research serves to highlight the importance of share social meaning and structure in all societies regardless of size (macro or micro) or stratification (rigid or wispy).",

To introduce the gamification elements and lay the foundation for\ncharacter analysis, we start the semester with a character creation assignment (which is labeled\nas a “dossier” to fit the overall theme) and a related discussion. Our use of a gamification\nassignment and follow-up discussion addresses ideological perceptions of identity via avatars\nand creates a safe space in the classroom for individualized student identities. The dossier task\nleads into discussions of gaming stereotypes and representation with an emphasis on challenging\nbinaries present in this medium.

The author utilizes Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann’s concept of the excursion to analyze how participants use roleplay in Dungeons and Dragons to achieve empowerment. Many of the women interviewed described being subjected to gendered behavioral expectations both in their everyday life and during gameplay. With an empowering gaming group, however, roleplay allowed the participants to challenge, and subvert, those gendered expectations. The author concludes that roleplay provides an empowering excursion from everyday life that allows women participants to deal with frustration about gendered treatment and challenge institutional gender roles",

In this research, we reached out to an expert community of crafters of social experiences: larpers (live action role players). Larpers and larp designers have a longstanding tradition of designing and making use of a variety of elements, such as costumes, physical objects, environments, and recently also digital artifacts. These are crafted in support of co-experience values that we argue can inform the design of social wearables. We engaged in a co-design process with a game designer and co-founder of a larp production company, and embedded the resulting social wearables in a larp. Here, we present the results of this design and implementation process, and articulate design affordances that resonate with our larp designer' values. This work may inspire and inform researchers and designers creating wearable technology that is aimed at supporting collocated engagement. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",

		"abstract": "Cette étude porte sur la « culture geek » et son émergence en tant que sous-culture et identité culturelle revendiquée en France depuis le milieu des années 2000. En effet, ce mouvement d’abord américain a fait une entrée remarquée dans l’espace public qui incite à s’interroger sur sa réalité sociologique. Les geeks sont abordés ici comme fans de mondes imaginaires fantastiques (science-fiction, fantasy…), passionnés de nouvelles technologies et en tant que public premier et fondateur du processus de convergence culturelle théorisé par Henry Jenkins. La montée en visibilité du phénomène geek est ainsi liée dans cette étude à celle de pratiques médiatiques associées à ce processus (fanfictions, démocratisation des outils numériques, œuvres transmédiatiques et immersives, etc.). Dans ce cadre, le tournant réflexif (vers un sentiment d’appartenance à une identité collective) et la mode médiatique autour de la culture geek ces dernières années trouvent leurs racines dans les moments fondateurs de la convergence culturelle (depuis les pulps fictions et la naissance des comic books jusqu’à la sortie de Star Wars, du Seigneur des anneaux, des premiers jeux de rôles et jeux vidéo). Mais cela doit aussi à la radicalisation récente des croisements médiatiques, des pratiques participatives, de la mondialisation des partages liée aux technologies numériques et au passage des identités prescrites aux identités choisies dans les sociétés contemporaines marquées par l’individualisme.",

		"abstract": "What can the classic zombie movie, Day of the Dead, tell us about leadership? In our analysis of this film, we explore leadership behaviours in an extreme context – a zombie apocalypse where survivors face persistent existential threat. Extreme context research presents methodological challenges, particularly with regard to fieldwork. The use of films as proxy case studies is one way in which to overcome these problems, and for researchers working in an interpretivist perspective, 'social science fiction' is increasingly used as a source of inspiration and ideas. The contribution of our analysis concerns highlighting the role of leadership configurations in extreme contexts, an approach not previously addressed in this field, but one that has greater explanatory power than current perspectives. In Day of the Dead, we observe several different configurations – patterns of leadership styles and behaviours – emerging, shifting and overlapping across the phases of the narrative, each with radically different consequences for the group of survivors. These observations suggest a speculative theory of leadership configurations and their implications in extreme contexts, for exploring further, with other methods.",

		"abstract": "The society we live in leads us to rethink education and communication languages, especially in educational processes concerning children and adolescents. It seems increasingly difficult to build meaningful educational experiences able to involve young people in transformative processes and overcome the ingrained \"nihilistic sense\". The new digital paradigm and the evolving perceptions of corporeal forms bring some crucial changes we need to explore. The social science teachings need, therefore, to be renewed to better deal with knowledge and skills in an interactive environment, promoting creativity, aesthetics, global and critical thinking and to promote relevant societal change. A possible educational method to tackle these realities can be given by the Educational Live Action Role Play (hereafter \"Edu-larp\"). An Edu-larp is a live role-playing game in which the narration is not only told but also played in first hand by the participants with their body and their actions. Players interact each other by interpreting a character and playing fictitious situations in a real space (\"magic circle\"). Despite the Edu-larp still being a growth method, several studies are highlighting its specific benefits, which include: identity exploration, communities building and cooperation, transversal skills, didactic media, problem solving, empathy, and self-awareness. The presented study builds on the findings of an experimental research on two migration-themed Edu-larps: \"Youth On The Run\" which simulates the migratory journey of an asylum seeker family from Somalia to Italy for 24 hours; and \"300, the battle of the tent cities\" which simulates a 4-hour municipal meeting in which the participants have to decide the placement of 300 refugees arriving in their city. It aims to enquire whether both games have significant effects on the participants' empathy and ethnic prejudices. The research was conducted on 82 subjects who partook an Edu-larp, using an open-question survey, psychometric scales and Implicit Association Test (IAT). The test was iterated three times: one week before, one week after and three months after the game. This paper will present the research design, the first reflections on the relationship between a \"game for social change\", and possible Edu-larp paths in future of education.",

		"abstract": "This ethnography examines the construction of a Secondary World within Live Action Role\nPlay. Based on five months of anthropological research in the United Kingdom, its aim is to\nplace LARP within the context of existing anthropology on play and performance and\nexamine how LARP constructs an alternate reality for the players. LARP is separated from\nthe mundane world by the “magic circle”, created by explicit rules and the social contract. In\ngame, players strive for immersion, similar to the concept of flow, in which players feel that\nthey are their characters. This immersion is enabled by character performance, a fully\nsensorial atmosphere, and personal relationships between the characters. Once immersed,\nplayers no longer feel as if they are acting, but rather that the character has taken over. This\nimmersion allowed players to enter the Enchanted State and an alternate reality in which\ncharacters are performative and actions within game were referred to as authentic. This adult\nplay allows players to construct a fragile alternate reality based on the belief of its players.",

		"abstract": "Costume Agency in German Larp has two aims. First, it contributes to the understanding of costumes as collaborators in a larp network. Second, it shows that the change towards a network perspective expands the understanding of games as relational processes. An actor-network analysis of the costume builds on first-hand data from three larps. Data analysis required a set of qualitative methods based upon participatory observation and qualitative interviews. The results of the analysis are: 1. Larp works, because the costume contributes to role playing. 2. The costume contributes when it changes its arrangement of material actors to fulfill the demands of the network. 3. Costume contribution demands changes from narrative and ludic actors as well and the result of these negotiations is a development of the network. 4. The development of the three observed larp networks resulted in costumes that work towards the 360° illusion ideal, change game rules, and raise the popularity of one favored narrative genre: Fantasy. Following the costume and tracing its work, reveals how larp as a network of heterogeneous actors structures itself. These processes become visible with an actor-network perspective that reaches beyond the division of agency as being driven by human or material actors.",

This paper presents the key traits of such systems and the potential impact of those traits on in-game information behaviour. \nMethod. LARP elements reported in earlier research have been identified as documents and subject representations and then analysed from an information system perspective. \nAnalysis. In order to access the information nature of this social activity and the temporary space in which it takes place, a combination of systems analysis and descriptive phenomenology was used to analyse the game elements. \nResults. LARP play and its temporary reality are shown to match the patterns of information systems and LARP play to be analysable as a type of information behaviour. \nConclusions. It is possible to not only model LARPs as information systems, but also define their traits to a degree that permits reliable study of information behaviour in such temporary environments.",

This article examines that connection by using data gathered over several decades in library and information science, studies of religion, and the cognitive sciences. The authors place particular emphasis on the similarity between social information phenomena present in both ritual and pretence, and the way those affect cognition—the seemingly “magical” interface that makes shared experiences possible. The authors show the implications of that pattern to the design of games and discuss its uses and limitations in games and experiences created for educational purposes.",

La question que pose cette thèse est celle des efforts, des activités ou des \" travaux \" que doit effectuer le joueur de jeux de rôles grandeur nature quand il veut s'immerger dans un univers fictionnel.

Le premier effort consiste à accéder à l'univers en créant un personnage actif et autonome ; le second revient à interagir au sein du monde fictionnel dans un double mouvement qui consiste à repousser ses cadres tout en les renforçant ; le troisième implique d'imaginer des modes d'organisation pour donner un cadre à l'action.",

Nous proposons ici une étude de cas d’une pratique à la croisée du jeu de rôle enfantin spontané et du jeu de rôle grandeur nature pour adulte. Menée sous la forme d’un stage estival, cette activité nous permet de comprendre comment adultes et enfants peuvent ponctuellement participer ensemble à l’écriture d’un récit qui prendra la forme d’un jeu en actes et en paroles. Une des caractéristiques principales de cette forme hybride est que l’enfant est placé dans une position d’auteur, d’acteur et de spectateur. Mais contrairement à ses propres jeux, il est en permanence sous la surveillance et la conduite d’adultes qui supervisent le développement du récit et la conformité des actions par rapport aux règles. Le jeune joueur est donc dans une posture originale : il produit une partie du contenu narratif du jeu dont il n’est pas l’acteur unique (en créant par exemple son personnage). Lui aussi veut raconter une histoire, mettre en place un scénario, créer des règles et faire jouer les adultes, comme dans son jeu enfantin. Mais les règles changent, il n’est plus omnipotent et doit jouer dans des cadres de simulation qu’il contribue à définir.",

Main research themes are the construction of game/play space and identities. Within this context I elaborate in this paper on the usefulness of the term magic circle (Johan Huizinga). I will argue why in game research the current use of the term magic circle is problematic. We can understand the term differently when returning to the context in which Huizinga introduced the magic circle as ritual play-ground. According to him ritual is play and play is ritual. Referring back to his work Homo Ludens (1938) I will discuss the various relationships between role-play and ritual performance. I will argue that fantasy role-playing consists of collections of performances or ritual acts, in which players construct the game/play space, identities and meaning.",

Le présent travail est le résultat d’une ethnographie au sein de ces milieux. Il cherche à la fois à rendre compte de cette pratique et à analyser les enjeux qui lui sont liés. C’est une réflexion polyphonique qui lie les questionnements de l’identité, tant individuelle que collective et la performativité à travers, notamment, les travaux de Deleuze, Agamben et Butler. La forme éclatée dans laquelle interviennent différentes voix reprend l’idée de chaos carnavalesque,motif central dans la présente analyse.",

On les dit geeks ou créatifs culturels, amateurs de littératures de genre, qui se pressent à de multiples conventions et festivals dédiés. Si ce travail de recherche se penche sur ce public connecté dans une culture plurielle, globalisée par les nouveaux médias et technologies, c'est pour mieux cerner les enjeux du développement local par la médiation culturelle. Qui mieux que les collectivités territoriales est à même d'identifier et de valoriser la plus-value qu'apporte ces passionnés ? C'est la question à laquelle nous tenterons de répondre.",

The Nordic LARP scene has been a creative, dynamic and experimental environment where questions regarding the design of intrigue and interaction have been explored from many perspectives. Over the past years the knowledge within this subcultural context has spread into several academic fields, into the schools of the nordic countries, to the national theatre stages, into other types of games and also into mainstream. media. During this keynote Carl Heath will take us on a journey into this subculture, on an exploratory path aiming to explain key elements in the design of the rich. and complex social worlds that can be found within LARPs in the Nordic countries.",

		"abstract": "Live action role playing games can be used for educational purposes (edu-LARPs), but information about their learning effectiveness is limited. To our knowledge, even quantitative instruments for in situ measuring (i.e. during playing the game) of affective constructs, for instance flow or generalized positive and negative affect in edu-LARPs, are lacking. Existing instruments cannot be applied straightforwardly due to several reasons; most notably, because they are not gamified. Administering a non-gamified inventory in the game can influence/interrupt the states it is supposed to measure. The research aim of our new project is to investigate acquisition of mental models of mechanical devices learnt within an edu-LARP and correlate the quality of the acquired mental model with in situ flow and generalized positive/negative affect (planned N (similar to) 10 groups x 10 participants). So far, we have conducted three pilots (N = 10, 12, 13) for which we developed a new method for assessing these constructs by in-game questionnaires (and tested the LARP's plot, a sci-fi space opera). The results so far are promising in that we are able to administer the respective questionnaires in situ without adverse effects of the measurement process on these states; as reported by participants in post hoc focus groups. Our method can be probably used in other edu-LARPs provided certain requirements on the LARP's plot are met. Another result is that some components of flow (such as fluency/sense of control) seem to be influenced by role playing but others (such as absorption or time alteration) not so. This indicates that the notion of flow as a unitary construct may not be applicable in LARP contexts.",

		"abstract": "This work is the product of a six-year ethnographic study of a live-action role playing (LARP) community organized around the Intercon theater-style LARP convention. The work explores LARP as a practice, formed by this community. Though the practice evolves over time, this work shows some of the common structures evident in LARP practice considered good by the Intercon LARP community. The analysis of this ethnographic work shows commonalities with other forms of role play, including the history of social simulations used in formal and informal learning environments, theater, reenactment communities, and various role playing games. In addition to description and historical context, this work explores some of the structures evident in this community's LARP practice that set this practice apart as a significant form of participant production and collaborative storytelling. The work explores some of the constraints and affordances of designing, and co-designing, within this highly collaborative environment in ways that facilitate engagement with a variety of LARP participants. This exploration identifies the structure of LARP, in the abstract, as a combination of character, world, and theme, each of which are composed of story, environment, rules, and play. In this structure, play has an operational role in instantiating the other elements within LARP, turning written material, costuming, set design, and other forms of preparatory activity into reality through performance. Finally, this work explores the potential for LARP use as a tool for developing empathy, critical ethical reasoning, and various forms of content learning and technical competencies.",

Eux-mêmes héritiers des wargames et jeux de stratégie militaire, ils ont participé à une évolution historique du genre, caractérisée par une individualisation forte du personnage et la volonté d’étendre le domaine de jeu, de sortir des premiers donjons pour partir à la conquête d’un univers. Cet article propose d’étudier les changements apportés par le passage en grandeur nature des jeux de rôles, d’une part sur un plan historique, mais surtout en prenant en compte la façon dont l’introduction d’éléments traditionnellement attachés au récit de fiction va changer la perspective. Non seulement, l’organisation sociale du jeu va être modifiée, mais également, le rôle conféré aux acteurs va évoluer au même titre que les logiques d’écriture présidant à sa création.",

		"abstract": "This chapter discusses the challenges that may emerge for live action role-play (larp) communities at each inflection point of the group life cycle. According to Tuckman, groups mature over time and move through four stages: forming, norming, storming, and performing (e.g., Tuckman 1965; Tuckman and Jensen 1977). The aim of the present chapter is to discuss the ways in which the development of real larp communities fit with Tuckman’s theory and to highlight inconsistencies that may emerge, in particular due to the multiple layers that can comprise a role-playing experience (e.g., Fine 1983). Since each stage of the group life cycle is fraught with opportunities for member exit and group dissolution, we also argue that cultural practices of successful, long-standing larp communities have manifested to meet these challenges. For example, larp groups may begin a new session with a\n listen-up\nperiod in which players gather in a circle to discuss the rules and clarify any misconceptions before gameplay begins. This activity mirrors the “restorative circle” that can occur before schoolyard play (Costello, Wachtel and Wachtel 2010), which likely promotes group maintenance factors such as informal leadership and procedural voice. We hope this work will have applied value for members of successful larp groups that experience “growing pains” as, for example, the group enters the storming stage characterized by unclear boundaries and fragile self-esteem of group members (Thompson and White 2010, 4). Along  with the rules and activities described by role-play scholars (e.g., Montola 2008), this chapter draws on the practices common to a specific, anonymized larp group located in the United States. The scholarly foundation for this work is grounded in various disciplines, particularly industrial/organizational and social psychology, and role-playing studies.",

In this paper I describe a fourth form, pervasive role-playing, which often follows many conventions of larp, but break out of the magic circle of gameplay in order to interact with surrounding society. The central pleasures of pervasive role-playing are related to playing for real, with the environment and having a tangible, unmediated experience of being a part of a complete and physical world of fiction.",

		"abstract": "On the Edge of the Magic Circle studies two threads of contemporary \nwestern gaming culture: Role-playing and pervasive games. Recreational \nrole-playing includes forms such as tabletop role-playing games, larps \nand online role-playing games, while pervasive games range from treasure \nhunts to alternate reality games. A discussion on pervasive role-playing \nconnects these strands together.\n\nThe work has four larger research goals. First, to establish a \nconceptual framework for understanding role-playing in games. Second, to \nestablish a conceptual framework for understanding pervasive games. \nThird, to explore the expressive potential of pervasive games through \nprototypes. And fourth, to establish a theoretical foundation for the \nstudy of ephemeral games.\n\nThe central outcome of the work is a theory complex that explains and \ndefines role-playing and pervasive gaming, and allows them to be \nunderstood in the context of the recent discussion in game studies.\n\nIn order to understand these two borderline cases of games, the work \nestablishes a theoretical foundation that highlights gameplay as a \nsocial process. This foundation combines the weak social constructionism \nof John R. Searle with the recent game studies scholarship from authors \nsuch as Jesper Juul, Jane McGonigal, Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman.\n\nTyössä etsitään vastauksia neljään laajaan tutkimuskysymykseen. Ensinnäkin, työ pyrkii esittämään käsitteellisen kehyksen, jolla voidaan ymmärtää eri pelien puitteissa tapahtuvaa roolipelaamista. Toiseksi, työ esittää käsitteellisen kehyksen arkeen sulautuvien pelien ymmärtämiseksi. Kolmanneksi, työssä tutkitaan prototyyppien avulla arkeen sulautuvien pelien ilmaisullista potentiaalia. Ja neljänneksi, työssä luodaan teoreettista pohjaa häviävien pelien tutkimiseksi.\n\nTyön keskeisin tulos on teoriamalli, jolla voidaan ymmärtää roolipelaamista ja arkeen sulautuvia pelejä viimeaikaisen pelitutkimuksen kontekstissa.\n\nTällaisten pelien rajatapausten ymmärtämiseksi työ on rakennettu perustalle, jossa pelaamisen luonnetta sosiaalisena prosessina korostetaan. Tässä perustassa yhdistetään John R. Searlen heikkoa sosiaalista konstruktionismia mm. Jesper Juulin, Jane McGonigalin, Katie Salenin ja Eric Zimmermanin poikkitieteelliseen pelitutkimukseen.",

A failure to maintain interest means that the\nsimulation or game fails in its purpose.

The central challenges of the long duration was merging the game and life in a functional manner, game mastering the game for extended periods, and pacing and structuring the game in a working way.

		"abstract": "Every summer, a group of role-playing gamers gathers in an American town. Dressed up as moon goddesses, mad scientists, and other fantastical characters, they act out elaborate, improvised narratives of transformation, destruction, and redemption. For several summers, this group, who I call the Journeyfolk, ran a camp for teenagers on the autism spectrum, engaging campers in therapeutic reconfigurations of self and social role. Through this folk healing practice, the meaning of autism was itself transformed; what had been a source of isolation became a source of commonality and community. This paper takes the camp as a case study for examining the co-productive relationship between culture and neurodiversity. Cognitive tendencies often found in autism are often thought to preclude socio-cultural participation. However, such tendencies can also facilitate the co-creation of innovative cultural spaces, through processes of affinity and affiliation. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork at the camp, I identify three sites of congruity between the culture of the camp and the cognitive and phenomenological experiences associated with autism, at which this “work of culture” (Obeysekere in The Work of Culture: Symbolic Transformation in Psychoanalysis and Anthropology, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1990) took place: the structure of social interactions within roleplaying games, the narratives enacted within these games, and the interpersonal relationships within which the games were embedded.",

This paper studies two freeform role-playing games aiming to create extremely intense experiences of tragedy, horror, disgust, powerlessness and self-loathing, in order to gratify the self-selected group of experienced role-players. Almost all of the 15 interviewed players appreciated their experiences, despite crying, experiencing physiological stress reactions and feeling generally ―bad‖ during the play.",

		"abstract": "In this paper, I analyze the design of a Dutch live-action role-playing game (LARP), based on the television series Firefly. I discuss it as part of the recent participatory culture in which fans mediate existing fiction into other products such as games. Game studies have often bypassed types of gaming that are initiated by players themselves by taking professional and digital games as their starting points. By focussing on a local example of a fan game, I hope to provide new insights in game design and play. After disseminating between fan and game practices, and sketching some of the previous research thereof, I shall elaborate upon the design of the game in four ways by focussing on the designer, the context, the participants and its construction of meaningful play. I argue that the fan LARP displays a particular design perspective based on the co-creative ethos of role-playing and fandom itself. Whereas existing research isolates the actors that are relevant in game practices, designer, player and fan modes clearly interrelate here.",

		"abstract": "In this research pedagogical live action role playing is examined as a method of teaching history. The objective of this research is to present and define the concept of pedagogical live action role playing as a method of teaching history and examine its capability in teaching historical empathy. Pedagogical live action role playing is a teaching method under development which has elements from drama pedagogics and different learning theories. The theoretical part of this research consists of play theories and drama pedagogical theories which are relevant to live action role playing, and also the concepts of historical empathy and historical thinking. In drama pedagogics the main sources are the researches of Laakso (2004) and Heikkinen (2002, 2004). The historical part uses the researches of VanSledright (2002), Cooper (2000) and Ashby and Lee (1987) as its main sources. \n\nThe research was carried out at the Viikki Teacher Training School in the class 6b during autumn 2007. The research material consists of three-phased interviews. During all phases three pupils were interviewed, and during two of the phases, also the teacher of the class was interviewed. The methods used in the interviews were thematic interview and stimulated recall -interview. The data gathered from the interviews was analyzed using content analysis. \n\nPedagogical live action role playing has three phases when teaching history: pre-game (preparations), game (live action role play) and post-game (discussion after the game and in the classroom). The teacher's attention and carefulness is important during all phases. The mistakes made in the pre-game face e.g. in writing the characters seem to cause major problems in the pupils' game experiences. \n\nPedagogical live action role playing is capable of teaching historical empathy, but according to my research this has some conditions, from which the most important is the pupil's historical knowledge before the game. Teaching historical empathy was based on esthetic dualition: the pupil made decions about the actions of his character as him/herself. The more background information the pupil had about the era they played, the more the pupil seemed to make decisions based on his historical empathy, aka his understanding of the era of the larp and of the people of the same era.",

		"abstract": "In this Master’s thesis the pervasive larp Prosopopeia Bardo 2: Momentum is studied as a case example of how the consciously constructed diegetic realities of live action role-playing interact and clash with that of everyday life. The analysis of the player experience in Momentum is divided in three parts: how the frames of ordinary life and the game exist on top of each other, how the player slips from one frame to another, and how the participants of the game negotiate these frames with each other and with the non-participants they encounter.       The analysis is conducted using Erving Goffman’s (1974) frame analysis and Gary Alan Fine’s (1983) role-playing specific elaboration of it. It is based on participant observation, email interviews with the player before, during and after the games, as well as semi-structured interviews with half of the players after the game. In addition to the three frames that Fine has described in his study of tabletop role-playing games – the primary framework, the playing frame and the game frame – there are numerous other frames present in a pervasive larp. The participants shift between these numerous frames, but they also employ a dual vision, seeing the events both as ludic and as ordinary.       The work has been conducted as part of the EU-funded Integrated Project for Pervasive Gaming. The thesis tackles an isolated research question separated from the larger framework building on a theoretical framework developed in the context of IPerG by Markus Montola and Annika Waern. In addition to sociology the work builds on ludology (game studies).       In the thesis it is proposed that frame analysis is a good tool in uncovering the inner working of a pervasive larp. However, as a method it falls short when the analysis of the internal processes of a player is attempted. The thesis also offers results for the design theory of pervasive larps: It discusses what hinders and supports immersion and offers a general interaction model for socially expanded pervasive larps.",

		"abstract": "Currently, game research is characterized by the (re)construction of contested boundaries such as the “magic circle” of the game experience. These boundaries create dichotomies, for instance, between the real and the imaginary that hide the complexity of actual play, design and research. In this thesis I propose to go “beyond the magic circle” in order to understand games and play from a network perspective. My case study is role-play in the online game World of Warcraft (Blizzard Entertainment 2004), whereby players act out the roles of their Fantasy characters. I understand Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) as networks of social interaction in which players (human actors) interact both with each other and with the system (nonhuman actors). Through interaction, role-players are creating meaning and social bonds that stretch out far beyond dichotomies such as in-character and out-of-character, in-game and out of game, real and imaginary, leisure and work or education, virtual and material, online and offline. The emergence of Fantasy role-playing games, of which the pen and paper game Dungeons and Dragons (D&D, 1974) is the first and World of Warcraft (WoW, Blizzard Entertainment, 2004) is one of the latest incarnations, ties in with the development of what sociologist Manuel Castells termed the network society. Through rich empirical case studies in his trilogy The Information Age: economy, society and culture (1996, 1997 and 1998), he mapped how since the late 1960s we have been witnessing a shift from hierarchies to networks in all sectors of society. Castells’ work is part of a growing body of network theory in which our society, including science itself, is understood as a complex system shaped by processes within and between actor networks that are often powered by information and communication technologies. In order to study MMORPGs as networks, I made use of Actor Network Theory as it is formulated within science and technology studies (Callon 1986, Law 1987, Latour 1987, 2005), Thomas Gieryn's concept of boundary work (Gieryn 1983, 1999), Erving Goffman’s work on social interaction (Goffman 1956, 1974), and the concept of “situatedness,” a crucial addition that Donna Haraway made to network theory, which aims to make visible how scholars are positioned in constantly morphing network structures (Haraway 1991). This thesis contributes to 1) an understanding of online role-playing games as networks that interact with daily life, Fantasy game culture, and the broader technological and socio-cultural developments over the last thirty years; 2) a description and analysis of role-play as a specific MMORPG play style that is characterized by its negotiation principles, and thus to understand the roles, conventions, identities, and interpersonal relationships that self-proclaimed role-players negotiate in and through the systems of a commercially distributed game; and, finally, 3) an understanding of how collaborative play, design, and game research are closely intertwined. Going “beyond the magic circle” has profound implications for both epistemology and education in game research and design. A network epistemology asks for interdisciplinary academic work that combines not only scholarship from the humanities and social sciences, but also from computer sciences. Furthermore, it calls for a societal contextualization of scholarship and a connecting of fundamental and applied theorization both “inside” and “outside” academia, done by players, designers, and academics, roles that more often can be found in one person. A networked education teaches a specialization in the context of other research and design disciplines, as the ability and passion to create unexpected blends is crucial for future innovative developments in play, design, and research.",

		"abstract": "Game-based learning may present a way of creating immersion and engagement for the learner through simulated experiences in a narrative environment, and may support the development of 21st. century skills of communication, collaboration, creativity and critical thinking. Role playing games have had a long history of usage in language learning and as a multidisciplinary activity in schools during theme weeks. Through the concept of serious digital games, which offers learning through digital simulations and immersion in virtual worlds, game-based learning has been deployed increasingly in education where games have been used for specific subjects. The use of live role-game playing in schools offers novel and innovative ways to work with the game genre, with the teachers contributing as game authors and game masters. A current project on live action role-game playing looks at how role-game playing can be used to present an entire curriculum within a narrative framework in order to enhance the learners' motivation and zest for learning while developing 21st century learning skills. The exploration of how live action role-game playing can function as an overarching framework for learning may offer fresh insights into game-based learning in terms of multimodality, flexibility in the design of games and the role and interactivity of the learner and teacher. A unique residential school dedicated to teaching all subjects in grades 9-10 through live role-game play was studied for a year. The study employed qualitative and processual methodologies in order to capture the interactions between students' learning experiences and the role-game based learning designs as well as the way they constitute a creative and collaborative learning environment. This paper presents the preliminary results of the project and discusses its implications for design and redesign of learning environments in the schools along with the roles of learners and teachers in the development of game-based learning as a framework for creative, inclusive and collaborative learning.",

		"abstract": "A ROLE-PLAYING situation I use to teach revising strategies in business and technical writing classes helps to motivate and involve my students, who typically have considerable work experience. This article describes the role play, which concerns draft and revised versions of a memo about a fatal plane crash sent by a communications manager to her employees (Lay, Wahlstrom, Rude, Selfe, & Selzer, 1995/2000, pp. 274, 276). ROLE-PLAYING Role-playing is a well regarded learning activity (McKeachie, 2002). By participating in this activity, students can apply their knowledge through their assigned roles in a realistic but risk-free situation. The role play stimulates class discussion, dramatizes rhetorical principles about purpose, shows how to adapt a text to an audience of employees in a nonacademic setting, and allows students to reflect on their own work experience and its impact on their behavior after the role play. Students build on the knowledge of management types that they gained in courses or in their own work experience, especially the distinction between Theory X and Theory Y managers as described by Douglas McGregor (see, for example, Koontz & O'Donnell, Weihrich, 1980) and Theory Z, inspired by Ouchi (1981). The role play does not require rehearsal and uses only short scripts that are provided to the cast at the beginning of class. It also involves many students who both act out assigned parts and engage in spirited discussion. THE SITUATION Briefly, all the students pretend to work for a corporate communications manager, Jane Lilly, who wrote draft and revised versions of a fictional memo to employees at the Jeppesen Corporation (Appendixes A and B). In the first draft of the memo, she berates employees for drawing charts with the wrong scale, leading to the fatal plane crash and lawsuit that the company lost. As a result of her comments, my students, in the role of Jeppesen employees, feel that the manager has chastised and blamed them for the tragedy. In contrast, the revised memo explains court rulings and enlists the cooperation of the staff to prevent further communication failures. Carrying Out the Role Play At the beginning of class, I assign two students to read the memos aloud, three students to represent the three management styles, and one student to serve as a master of ceremonies (MC). These students face the class on a makeshift stage at the front. The managers stand by giant cards bearing the letters of their appropriate style to remind the class about who they represent. The rest of the class takes on the role of writers in the communication department at Jeppesen and vote by a show of hands on what management style Lilly uses. To begin the role play the MC says, \"Good [morning/afternoon], ladies and gentlemen. These three managers will tell you about their management styles.\" Next, Manager X says, \"I am Manager X. I use Theory X management. Workers are lazy. You have to stand over them with a stick to get them to work.\" Alter that, Manager Y says,.",

The difficulty for teachers involved in higher education is\nhow to engage students in their learning in an emotionally challenging way while maintaining a\nclassroom environment in which students feel safe. In the following instructional paper, the use of\nrole-play as a pedagogical approach for enhancing learning through emotional engagement will be\ndiscussed. The paper highlights how the author makes use of role-play to provide genuine emotional\nchallenges for students in a tertiary setting while still providing a safe learning environment.",

		"abstract": "Instructional activities based on online discussion strategies have gained prevalence in recent years. Within this context, a crucial research topic is to design innovative and appropriate online discussion strategies that assist learners in attaining a deeper level of interaction and higher cognitive skills. By analyzing the process of online discussion in depth using a specific instructional strategy, we may discover the characteristics and limitations of this strategy. This case study utilizes an online discussion activity adopting a role-playing strategy in a college course and conducts an empirical analysis to explore and evaluate both the content structure and behavioral patterns in the discussion process. We propose and adopt a new method of multi-dimensional process analysis that integrates both content and sequential analysis, whereby the dimension of interaction and cognition are analyzed simultaneously. Furthermore, we discuss the patterns, characteristics, and limitations of the role-playing discussions and provide suggestions as references for teachers who utilize online role-playing discussion activities.",

		"abstract": "Background:  There has been a rapid growth of online teaching in the past few years, yet the implementation of role-play for formal educational activities in an online setting is growing more slowly. The use of online role-playing for the development of health professions educators is virtually un-documented in the literature. Innovation:  In the project reported here we use role-playing as a method to motivate and increase active participation in an online web-based discussion on community-based medical education (CBME). The Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education & Research (FAIMER®) Institute hosts virtual group discussions for fellows as part of its fellowship programmes, in order to deepen their knowledge base in health professions education and research. In June 2008, a group of seven FAIMER® fellows and faculty members moderated an online discussion on CBME using an online role-play exercise with other fellows and faculty members. Results:  Out of a total of 102 fellows, 36 (35.3%) participated actively, which exceeded the typical percentage of list server participation. In addition, a rich discussion resulted in a comprehensive report on the goals, challenges, logistical components, role of Health Ministry policy and the possible ethical mandate of CBME in developing countries. Conclusion:  Online role-play encouraged distributed participation among a highly diverse international group of participants, supporting the conclusion that role-playing can be used effectively with mid-career health professional faculty members in the online environment.",

Clad in duct-tape armor, clutching swords and axes made of PVC pipe, foam, and more duct tape, the warriors slide stealthily up to a closed door. The lead warrior gestures to the monk and the women to hide in a corner; the monk positions his body between the women and the door. With a synchronized cry, the three warriors throw open the closed door, surprising two duct-taped goblins and a black-cloaked wizard. The warriors coordinate their strikes, delivering fatal blows to the goblins and injuring the wizard's hands so he is unable to cast spells.

Cette \ncontribution étudie la façon dont ils collaborent dans des rassemblements qui peuvent \natteindre 8 000 participants, sans forcément se connaitre au préalable ni connaitre en \ndétail l’univers du jeu. L’hypothèse est que le jeu crée ses propres cadres d’action, \nnotamment en agissant sur la temporalité et génère ainsi des modes de socialisation \naccélérée.",

The focus of this particular study is on a predominately all male campus group of \"Live Action Role Players\" called \"Dagorhir.\"  I explore how sub-cultural processes in the construction of group identity are gendered through their relation to the manhood acts perspective (Schrock & Schwalbe, 2009). I focus on how the meanings of actions by (mostly male) participants referred to as \"epic glory\" relate to the elicitation of deference, resistance of exploitation, and assertion of control key in signifying manhood. I then relate these group processes to the unintended consequences of perpetuating gender inequality within the group and elsewhere.",

		"abstract": "This account of a UK live-action roleplay (LARP) event highlights complex shifts between different interpretive frames, foregrounding the role of the physical setting as well as of non-players and locals in providing symbolic resources that inhibit or support breaking frames. The conception of framing used here draws upon and extends Goffman’s definition of a frame as part of the organization of activity that specifies meaning and expectations of involvement. In looking at the setting of such framing processes ethnographically, this article presents UK LARP as a distinctive engagement with rural materiality and a creative alternative to traditional country pursuits. From the point of view of a game organizer, the paper identifies the creation of specific contextual frames by the visiting hobbyists associated with three interpretations: 1) a narrative conception of the space as a backdrop for fantastical events, 2) a ludic conception of the space as an area of game-playing, 3) an event conception of the space and its inhabitants as something to be managed. Three examples of disruptions to the work employed to maintain these frames demonstrate the fragility of the magic involved in this fantastical hobby. © The British Association of Hand Therapists Ltd 2015.",

Well-defined characters that are consistently communicated to players are an important ingredient in a potentially successful game. In this paper I will explore the important aspects in a character, those that support and make character immersion possible. My starting point is that in a role-playing game posing as somebody else is elementary to the game. This is close to arguments that character immersion is a key element of a role-playing. The pleasurable role-playing experience thus requires a player to be able to present a character and (to some extent) experience what the character is experiencing.",

Research for this article was conducted in Moscow and St. Petersburg LARP communities, establishing a database with over 600 cases of “going out of character” in 2012-13. Analysis suggests that in certain cases breaks of game frame can enrich a LARP for its participants rather than spoil it. The results can be useful for enhancing sociological and anthropological understanding, including in such approaches as interaction analysis, community building research, game studies, and ludology.",

		"abstract": "Live-action role-play (larp) has been named a “new performative art,” an immersive experience, and an educational tool, but it is much more: A playground of intermingling social and cultural realities, a door to new worlds. This paper offers an introduction to larp, its transcultural history, and its disruptive and creative possibilities, as well as key aspects, such as immersion. It sets the theoretical frame for the game “Staying Alive,” in which the researchers and also the audience engage in a shared “mimetic evocation of ‘real-life experience.’” Many aspects of “everydayness” can be called “collateral realities,” realities that are done implicitly, unintentionally, such as nations, cultures, time, or distinctions of subject and object, or of presenter and audience; realities that could be different. Taking performativity seriously, larp can be a tool to step outside of a Euro-American commonsense ontology and its singular reality “out there” by playing with collateral realities and making their production explicit. During a larp, players (“larpers”) consciously undo objects and meanings, space, and even their very bodies to creatively weave new material-semiotic fabrics. They become cultural mediators between a world-that-supposedly-just-is and its partially connected others, in which Japaneseness or Chineseness may fade and Elvishness is translated into a reality. With a global player base, larping is not only a practice of intersubjective or cultural negotiations but also of intra-subjective mediation of cultural realities.",

Design/methodology/approach - Project System is a three-day experience for adult participants concerning totalitarian regime, freedom and inequality. The Project System does not give fast and easy answers but leads participants to find them on their own. For 30 hours, participants find themselves within a larp, which is a very intense type of role-playing game based on human interactions. The author has chosen a larp as a medium as one of the most immersive and influential method of game-based learning which can facilitate topics that are normally hard to explain through conventional methods of learning. Participants learn firsthand through their roles, emotions, story and experience. Findings - Project System was a really strong and important experience for many players that may have partially changed their lives. After more than 500 players walked through it, the author can say that this method is beneficial. Originality/value - Larp as an educational tool is used all over the world; however, there are still only few professional organizations. Most of them are focused on using larp (or similar role-playing methods) as a tool at elementary or secondary schools. Using larp in andragogy is currently pioneering.",

		"abstract": "Furries, self-identified fans of anthropomorphism, report feeling significant social stigma. As a result, furries rarely reveal their furry identity to mental health professionals, for fear of judgment or disapproval. Improving health practitioners' familiarity with the furry identity may improve the quality of care for furries seeking treatment for unrelated conditions. Six focus groups were conducted over three days at a furry convention in the Midwest United States to study the furry identity (59 self-identified furries ages 18 to 41). The authors define and describe the demographics of important distinctions within the furry community and discuss the furry identity and liken it to sexual orientation, noting that the stigma furries face—worsened by media that exaggerate fringe and rare behaviors—has made it challenging for furries to live authentically for fear of ostracism, violence, and discrimination. These factors have resulted in furries' reluctance to disclose their identities. Highlighting communication challenges, the authors discuss strategies for health professionals to engage with furries in a clinical setting and to uphold unconditional positive regard.",

In this thesis I explore the complexities of the fictional worlds created by larps and how the participation in larps constructs requires a different engagement with traditional thoughts about narrative. Discussing fictional worlds theory, Aristotle, Frye, and Ricoeur along side concepts from game studies, such as the magic circle and the frames of exogeny, endogeny, and diegesis, I propose an alternative approach to understanding narrative within larps that looks at the larp worlds and plot as being driven by a process of affirming the identities constructed to participate within the fictional worlds through the mimetic process.",

		"abstract": "Roleplaying activities of various sorts are frequently used to train specific skills or to conduct social science studies. The research on the use of roleplays finds that the more realistic the roleplay, the more effective it is as a teaching tool, at least for easily definable behaviors. Activities such as leadership, decision making, and working with a group are all behaviors that are difficult to precisely define but which are also critically important to the ability of a group to accomplish a task. Research on groups finds that groups are more effective when group members are better educated about each of these topics. Viewed from a Dramaturgical perspective, leadership, decision making, and working with a group can be seen as group members filling certain roles and engaging in role appropriate activities in order to accomplish the tasks of the group and manage the impressions group members have of one another. This study employed a qualitative, grounded theory methodology to explore how participants in Live Action Role Playing (LARP) games, a form of immersive, complex, plot-driven roleplay perceive leadership, decision making, and working with a group. A total of 14 participants provided rich, detailed responses to an open-ended questionnaire that explored their perceptions of each of the three topics being investigated, and also explored how they perceived LARP as influencing those perceptions. Based on the results of the study, a theory was developed connecting LARP participation to an enhanced ability to understand leadership, decision making, and working with a group.",

This article studies two non-digital freeform role-playing games, The Journey and Gang Rape, that aim to create extreme experiences of tragedy, horror, disgust, powerlessness and self-loathing. Even though the games successfully produce unpleasant experiences, they gratify their target group of experienced role-players. Almost all of the sixteen interviewed players appreciated their experiences, despite crying, experiencing physiological stress reactions and feeling generally ‘bad’ during play. It was also found out that players feel intimately connected after play, and felt the need for thorough debriefing afterwards. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

		"abstract": "We frequently engage with that which we consciously perceive not to be real, yet fantasy, despite its pervasive presence and strong role in everyday life through its connection to identities, communities, desires, and meanings, has yet to be properly defined and researched. This book examines fantasy from a performance theory perspective. Drawing on multidisciplinary literature, it presents ethnographic and art-based research on live action role-playing games to explore fantasy as a bodily and negotiated phenomenon that involves various kinds of engagement with one’s surroundings. Overall, this book is a study of various forms and roles that fantasy can take on as part of contemporary Western culture. The study suggests that fantasy emerges as a different type of interpretation of normalised performance and reality, and can thus provide individuals with the tools to wield agency in everyday life. The book will appeal to scholars of sociology, cultural and media studies, literature and performance studies.",

The author also mentions (but not go deep into) the fact that the setting and plot of a particular larp also can be classified in the same manner.\n\nIn the commentary, the editors point out that the terminology predates the article, and wonders how the theory can be brought forward towards connecting larp writing and playing.",

		"abstract": "Game-based learning is supposed to motivate learners. However, to what degree does motivation driven by interest in playing an instructional game affect learning outcomes compared to motivation driven by interest in the very learning process? This is not known. In this study with a unique design and intervention, young adults (N = 128; a heterogeneous sample) learned how to control an electro-mechanical device in a 40-minute-long learning session integrated into a 2-hour-long educational live action role-playing game (edu-LARP). Edu-LARPs are supposedly engaging games where players take part in team role-playing by physically enacting characters in a fictional universe. In our edu-LARP, players had to understand how the to-be-learned device worked in order to win the game. Departing from typical game-based learning research, learning- and playing-related variables were assessed for each learner separately (i.e., a within-subject design). Affective-motivational factors related to playing (rather than learning) predicted learning outcomes in a positive, but considerably weaker, way compared to learning-related, affective-motivational factors. Developed interest in LARP-like games was primarily related to enjoying the game rather than better learning outcomes; whereas, developed interest in the instructional domain was primarily related to enjoyment of learning and better learning outcomes. Overall, autonomous motivation to play was connected to higher learning outcomes, but this connection was weak.",

		"abstract": "The article deals with a phenomenon of historical reconstruction as youth amateur movement. Positive interpretation of the specified subject can serve as an additional material for further profound studying of such diverse phenomenon as reconstruction. The article purpose is to actualize the importance of the historical reconstruction, acting as an effective way of receiving new knowledge of the past of society in the context of education and upbringing of the younger generation. The source base of our research was made by a wide range of various sources: 1) the documents of the movement, including charters of clubs of historical reconstruction, the rules, the program, the regulations for running events etc.; 2) the Internet resources, presented by the websites and associations of clubs of historical reconstruction, which give the chance to expand the source base, and also to fill the niche, which was formed due to the lack of appropriate number of publications about this movement in Russia. The methodology and technique of the research is based on the principles of scientificity, the principles of dialectical connection of the cultural phenomena and processes; methods of theoretical and applied cultural science, and also the cultural and anthropological method, allowing to consider culture as the instrument of broadcast of new knowledge and practical skills in cultural and leisure domain of society. Despite the considerable amount of literature on various aspects of historical reconstruction, there is insufficiency of scientific developments on the subject of our research. At the same time, different types of reconstruction on the problems of its educational potential, gaming and cultural phenomenon have been examined by S.V. Bogdanov, N.S. Bozhk, E.M. Veselova, I.V. Glukharev, A.N. Milyukov, etc. While conducting the research, the authors have come to the conclusions that the amateur movement, including elements of the scientific direction, promotes development of interest in historical roots of people, knowledge of features of cross-cultural communication. The Internet resources, which provide the programs of numerous clubs of historical reconstruction, conducting scientific search, carrying out cultural and educational and general education work, serve as the confirmation to it. The monitoring of the concrete movement practices has shown that accumulation of knowledge of the past of society passes along most effectively in the form of thematic feasts, role-playing games of live action, show, which communicative space creates a unique opportunity to acquire new knowledge by preparation for game action. Thus, the prospects for further development of the phenomenon of historical reconstruction in getting to know the past of society consists in the analysis of various activities of participants of the movement on preservation of material and non-material cultural heritage, on reconstruction of ancient technologies under modern conditions, and also in continuous link of times, generations, traditions, providing inviolability of moral values and patriotic spirit among young people.",

		"abstract": "Purpose\nThis paper aims to propose LARPnography as a more holistic method to probe the emergence of plausible futures, drawing on embodied embedded cognition literature and the emerging consumer practice of live-action role-playing (LARP). Current research methods for probing the future of markets and society rely mainly on expert judgment (i.e. Delphi), imagery or simulation of possible futures (i.e. scenario and simulation) and perspective taking (i.e. role-playing). The predominant focus on cognitive abstraction limits the insights researchers can extract from more embodied, sensorial and experiential approaches.\nLARPnography is a qualitative method seeking to immerse participants within a plausible future to better understand the social and market dynamics that may unfold therein. Through careful planning, design, casting and fieldwork, researchers create the preconditions to let participants experience what the future may be and gather critical insights from naturalistic observations and post-event interviews.\nOwing to its interactive nature and processual focus, LARPnography is best suited to investigate the adoption and diffusion of innovation, market emergence phenomena and radical societal changes, including the rise of alternative societies.\nDifferent from previous foresight methods, LARPnography creates immersive and perceptually stimulating replicas of plausible futures that research participants can inhabit. The creation of a fictional yet socio-material world ensures that socially constructed meaning is enriched by phenomenological and visceral insights.",

It specifically explores the differences between, and sustainability of, mental models constructed within three various educational environments: (1) a digital game played on PCs, (2) a non-digital role-playing game, and (3) a traditional lecture with discussions. We conducted a laboratory experiment, in which participants (253 high school students, M = 112, F = 141, mean age 16.5) studied EU laws, institutions, and politics in the three above-mentioned environments. We evaluated and compared mental models participants constructed through content analysis of the concept maps they drew immediately after the experiment and others made one month later. Within the analysis, we studied content, architecture, and changes in mental models over time. The resulting data offer unique insight into the process of mental models creation and sustainability thereof within game-based learning; particularly, when using a digital game. Digital game-based learners’ concept maps differed in comparison with those of the educational role-playing and traditional lecture groups; the students tended to keep less altered mental models in their long-term memory: even after the one month period. The results suggest that a digital game-based learning environment could be more successful in mental model retention and for efficacy of future recall; particularly, when dealing with complex phenomena like EU law.",

		"abstract": "Purpose of the study is to identify markers, \"risk zones\" that contribute to deviations among representatives of the subculture \"roleviks\", to elaborate a technology to correct negative experiences among \"role\" movement representatives to increase the efficiency of their adaptation. The following research methods were used in this study: “Questionnaire of the hierarchical structure of actual personal fears” (ISAS) methodology to identify phobias; Personality Belief Questionnaire – PBQ to specify dysfunctional beliefs impeding adaptation (emotional well-being, constructive relationships with other people, etc.). The research results suggest that a systematic integrated approach is a necessary condition for the success of the psychological technology aimed at overcoming negative experiences and maladaptation of \"role\" movement subculture representatives. A combination of diagnostic and correctional models to overcome social fears, deprivation and maladaptation makes up the essence of the technology. The research provides findings that can be used by managers of various levels in the education system, social workers, teachers and practical psychologists in the education system; they can also be of use while organizing special programs for educators, social and psychological services. It has been worked out to help students - “roleviks” to overcome their social fears. It represents a system of single interrelated activities determined to form and develop personal adaptive resources. It has been established that positive changes in adaptation strategies, a decrease in the level of social fears and anxiety are the main criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the presented psychological-pedagogical technology. It is shown that the applied technology promotes the decrease of experienced fears intensity, forms stress resistance, and contributes to the selection of effective social interaction strategies.",

		"abstract": "The growing relevance of improvisation for successful organizing calls for a better understanding of how individuals develop improvisation skills. While research has investigated the role of training and simulations, little is known about how individuals develop improvisation skills when formal training is not an option and how individual-level factors shape development trajectories. We explore these issues in a longitudinal qualitative analysis of live action role-playing. Our findings reveal a three-stage process of improvisation development shaped by the presence of task and social structures, which act as both constraints and resources. Moreover, our findings illuminate how collaborative and competitive orientations shape whether improvisers perceive these structures as a resource that they need to nurture and renew (i.e., collaborative) or to seize and exploit (i.e., competitive). We also show that individual orientations are not always enduring but can change over time, engendering four types of improvisation development trajectories. Our work provides a longitudinal account of how individual orientations shape the process of improvisation development. In so doing, we also explain why individuals who are skilled improvisers do not necessarily improvise effectively as a collective, and we reconcile different conceptualizations of improvisation.",

		"abstract": "This chapter argues that Westworld functions as a role-play experience that continually entices its guests with suggested but unrealized layers of meaning and significance in its immersive western landscape. Where traditional role-play experiences deliver meaning through player and Game Master group interaction, Westworld provides its guests with violent escapism, sexual fantasy, and nostalgic indulgence. Within the series, the Westworld park presents itself as a combination of two aspects of tabletop role-playing game: sandbox format and Live Action Role-play (LARP). Within the role-play experience, the cultivation of motivation on the part of the Game Master entices players to undertake or follow particular narrative threads. Gameplay was designed to cultivate certain personality traits and instincts. Herein the game's rules, style and structures “influence a user's behavior without forcing the change” - essentially enacting education through restriction. In the case of role-play games, these restrictions are less over by the narrative nature of the game.",

		"abstract": "Focusing on the activities of LARGE (the Live Action Role-Playing Guild of Edmonton), several performance concepts are explored using the primary sources of five interview subjects and the author’s auto-ethnographic perspective on participating in LARPs in the Edmonton area. Some of these performance concepts are how LARP can be considered “improv in disguise,” how the use of rules systems both helps and hinders ideas of agency and immersion, and how issues of consent are essential to the success of creating a shared reality among diverse personalities. The article begins with an auto-ethnographic description of the LARP event Broken Covenant, which leads to explaining how LARGE began and how it differs from more well-known boffer LARPS. The article then drills down on the varied histories of the interview subjects and explores the concept of improvisation in LARP as ‘yes, but…,’ in comparison to the well-known improv mantra of ‘yes, and. …’ Agency and immersion are explored, leading to a discussion of emotional investment and, most important, consent. The article demonstrates that there is a vibrant and sophisticated LARP community in Edmonton (mostly transplanted from Saskatoon) creating performances in the non-traditional milieu of LARP.",

		"abstract": "Live action role-play (larp) is a recognized form of role-play where players physically embody characters in fictional settings. The medium is immensely versatile and different larp traditions approach the activity and its design in a variety of ways. \n \nThe participatory and ephemeral nature of larp makes it a difficult medium to explore without playing. It is, however, relevant to communicate aspects of the activity to external audiences for purposes of posterity and recognition. Larp documentation cannot encapsulate the fleeting artwork, as it lacks a permanent form. As the player is the central audience of larp, we seek to understand the player experience in order to comprehend the relevance of larp. The importance of documentation forces the larp community to explore new ways of capturing the dissipating artworks. \n \nThe study explores what can be captured of the ephemeral larp experience, and how it translates to outside audiences. The written part of the study examines characteristics of larp and central challenges for its documentation, as well as the creation of a fictional documentary film. The artistic part of the study is the outcome of an exploration of larp as a platform for creation, resulting in a fictional documentary called “Vielä hetki.” \n \nThe study shows that while larp is impossible to document thoroughly, parts of the ephemeral larp experience can be captured. Larp documentation should be approached as a collection of different documents, as no single document or medium can cover the whole larp. The medium can be used as a source for sampling, as larp provides a platform for artistic exploration but only allows parts of its expression to be captured. It is possible to create independent works of art inside larp that external audiences can relate to and to utilize such artworks in translating the exclusive larp experience to non-participants. When larp documentation is implemented into the fiction of the larp, it becomes a diegetic part of the larp and creates more intimate documents of the elusive and coveted player experience.",

This format encourages agency and collaboration as a means to playfully co-construct identity and reality within a group setting, which can lead to an increased sense of internal locus of control, as well as meta-reflection.\n\nThis presentation contextualizes larp with relationship to other therapeutic modalities that use storytelling and/or role enactment , e.g. psychodrama, sociodrama, Gestalt, narrative therapy, Integral Family Systems, inner child work, drama therapy, person-centred therapy etc. The presenters discuss some of the cognitive elements that make larp particularly useful as a tool, including the development of perspective taking, empathy, and metacognitive awareness through the dual consciousness of identification with character and aesthetic distancing. The presentation explore larp’s potential as a vehicle for learning -- including its limitations -- with an emphasis on theories of assimilation, accommodation, and cognitive dissonance, e.g. Knud Illeris’ work building upon concepts from Jean Piaget. \n\nThe presentation discusses a specific example of the ways players can use larp as a playground to experiment with identity and personally transform. This example centers upon player who use role-playing as a space for queer performance where they can feel secure enough in their containment to physically present as different gender identities than were assigned to them at birth. This process can not only feel radically liberating for queer participants, but can be paired with adjunctive therapeutic modalities to aid in their process of transitioning their gender socially outside of playful spaces. Thus, this presentation considers the potential of larp as a transformational container or holding environment for experimentation that can support other therapeutic processes occurring parallel to play.\n\nLearn more about the Transformative Play Initiative: https://www.speldesign.uu.se/research...\n\nLearn more about the Games &amp; Society Lab: https://www.speldesign.uu.se/research...\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/transformati...\nhttps://www.facebook.com/gamesandsoci...",

Stories are a collection of several tasks done by the characters in a certain sequence. If every task is taken as an independent entity, random distribution of these tasks can create a new story. We can then use Genetic Algorithms to create the characters required by those stories. Through user interaction, we can dictate what kind of characters and stories should be created and the computer slowly converges to creating stories according to the users liking. With the implementation of this methodology, we can ensure that no two plays of the same game should give the user the same experience. With user input we can ensure that the Genetic Algorithm learns with every play-through thus creating stories and characters that are more according to the liking of the user.",

		"abstract": "When designing tabletop digital games, designers often draw inspiration from board games because of their similarities (e.g., spatial structure, social setting, and physical interaction). As part of our tabletop handheld augmented reality (THAR) games research, in which computer graphics content is rendered and registered on top of the players’ view of the physical world, we are motivated to understand how social play unfolds in board games with the purpose of informing design decisions for THAR games. In this paper we report an empirical study of recorded video from a series of board game play sessions. We present five categories of social interactions based on how each interaction is initiated, among which we believe that the category of “chores” (interactions arising from the bookkeeping activities required to maintain and update game state) provides opportunities and support for four other kinds of social interaction, namely, “Reflection on Gameplay” (reacting to and reflecting on gameplay after a move); “Strategies” (deciding how to play before a move); “Out-of-game” (reacting to and talking about out-of-game subjects); and “Game itself” (commenting on and reacting to the game as an artifact of interest). We note that “chores” in board games (e.g. waiting for a turn, rule learning and enforcement, maneuvering physical objects), which at first appear to be merely functional, are critical for supporting players’ engagement with each other. Although most of these chores can be automated using technology, we argue that this is often not the best choice when designing social interactions with digital media. Based on our experience with THAR games, we discuss several design choices related to “chores”. To understand the connection between game design elements and social experience, we apply Interaction Ritual (IR) theory from micro-sociology to interpret our data.",

Current computational IS models are based on investigations about how games are planned by game designers and actually played by the audience. Unfortunately, most research efforts are limited to the structured data for obtaining insights about IS models. This paper presents a study aimed at determining which actions modeled by Role-Playing Games (RPG) are more important for actual gameplay and how these actions are related. For doing so, we first extracted textual data from existing adventures found in a play-by-forum RPG portal. Such gameplay data is written in Portuguese and reflect natural gameplay without observer intervention. Our analyses from a natural language processing perspective provide valuable insights for IS models in reducing the gameplay chasm between electronic and tabletop RPG. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

		"abstract": "It is perhaps one of the most overlooked curiosities of the digital age that not only computer games but the Internet too was shaped with the help of a small group of programmers, who were as much into Dungeons & Dragons as they were very enthusiastic about the professional exploration of caves (speleology). The first ‘adventure’ (a computer game genre that is paradigmatic for today’s game designs) started out as a simulation of cave exploration and today ‘caves, caverns and dungeons’ are still among the most used topics in game narration, artwork and design. From Tomb Raider to Uncharted, from The Bard’s Tale to World of Warcraft, the exploration of cave-like structures seems to be an integral part of a great number of games that were present from the beginning. In this chapter it is argued that there are intrinsic reasons why computer games maintain such a close relationship with speleological themes of all kinds.",

This article presents a comprehensive study of the role of interplayer communication during the gaming process in digital and tabletop role-playing game formats. A series of empirical game experiments are presented and the player-based communication analyzed, with the aim of clarifying how format (media of expression) impacts on verbal communication in multiplayer games; as well as examining player communication in general. The results show distinct differences in the communication patterns between the two game formats, directly related to the limitations and requirements of the tabletop and digital media utilized, for example in the amount of “in-character” communication. Interplayer communication in both formats is highly focused on functional content, that is, oriented towards supporting practical gameplay; however, functional content has different meanings on the two platforms. These and other results are discussed in the context of format differences and in the larger context of the functions of verbal communication during the playing of multiplayer games.",

The significance of video games within our everyday lives has certainly been increased and shaped by new technologies and gaming patterns, including the rise of home-based games consoles, advances in mobile telephone technology, the rise in more 'sociable' forms of gaming, and of course the advent of the Internet. This book explores the opportunities, challenges and patterns of gameplay and sociality afforded by the Internet and online gaming. Bringing together a series of original essays from both leading and emerging academics in the field of game studies, many of which employ new empirical work and innovative theoretical approaches to gaming, this book considers key issues crucial to our understanding of online gaming and associated social relations, including: patterns of play, legal and copyright issues, player production, identity construction, gamer communities, communication, patterns of social exclusion and inclusion around religion, gender and disability, and future directions in online gaming\"-- \"Over only a few decades, digital gaming has become a major global leisure activity that now rivals the movie and music sectors. Due to this increasingly widespread popularity, gaming has in recent years become the focus of increased academic interest and activity, but still little is know about those who play digital games. Online Gaming in Context is the first book to explicitly and comprehensively address how digital games are experienced and engaged with in the everyday lives, social networks, and consumer patterns of those who play them. In doing so, the book provides a key introduction to the study of gamers and the games they play, whilst also reflecting on the current debates and literatures surrounding the virtual world.",

		"abstract": "My straightforward observation of the activity of role-playing is that many participants do not enjoy it very much. Most role-players I encounter are tired, bitter, and frustrated. My goal in this writing is to provide vocabulary and perspective that enable people to articulate what they want and like out of the activity, and to understand what to look for both in other people and in game design to achieve their goals. The person who is entirely satisfied with his or her role-playing experiences is not my target audience.\nEverything in this document is nothing more nor less than \"What Ron Thinks.\" It is not an official Dogma for the Forge. It is not a consensus view of members of the Forge, nor is it a committee effort of any kind. It is most especially not an expectation for what you're supposed to think or believe.\nHowever, it does stand as the single coherent body of theory about role-playing at the Forge, and its lexicon is definitive for purposes of discussion there. I am satisfied with it, but I'm not unreasonable either, so it is not immutable. Please deal with it in one of the following ways: identify an inconsistency, ask for clarification and examples, or otherwise address its content critically. I am perfectly willing to amend any content, if I'm given a substantive reason to do so, and to give credit for the insight.\nI request that all discussion of this material be based on careful consideration. Snap judgments, unsupported value judgments, neophobia, taking offense, and other juvenile reactions are not welcome. Furthermore, I am well aware that my GNS notions vary greatly from the original Threefold Model (or GDS), and that my categories of Stance differs from those originally proposed. Identifying these differences does not constitute a criticism.\nI have been extensively influenced by the work of others and have incorporated it in ways which make sense to me. Concepts that were originated and developed by others are credited in the acknowledgments at the end.",

		"abstract": "This article presents a critical view of the concept of rules in game studies on the basis of a case study of role-playing across media. Role-playing in its traditional form is a complex activity including a game system and a number of communicative conventions where one player takes the role of the game manager in order to implement the rules and provide a world for the other players. In online role-playing games, a programmed system simulates the rule system as well as part of the game manager's tasks, while the rest of the activity is up to the players to define. Some aspects may translate more or less unproblematically across media, others are transformed by the introduction of the programmed system. This reveals some important perspectives on the sort of rules that can be simulated in a programmed system and what this means to the concept of rules in game studies.",

		"abstract": "Learner motivation is a major preoccupation for a professional training sector that is showing increasing interest in the use of learning games. The lack of methodologies and design tools seems to be problematic for the eLearning companies and training departments placed in charge of learning game projects. In this context, we have focused in particular on the design of scenarios for Learning Role-Playing Games or LRPG because of their ability to suit to needs identified. This article presents the main characteristics of our work. Our aim is to guide designers in the choices they make, in particular when it comes to the use of tailored game principles, to help them formalise and justify their choices in relation with the project specifications and to facilitate the implementation of the scenarios they design. With this in mind, our work takes a two-pronged approach: first, the analysis and modelling of a LRPG scenario design process based on the re-use of models and, second, the specification of a design-support environment (ScenLRPG) based on the model devised. The paper then focuses on a key stage of our work: the identification of game principles that may be used in a LRPG scenario. Six game principles have been identified from the study of literature on games and motivation. The article describes how these game principles are specialized to cater with our specific subject that is LRPG scenarios for professional training. Our categorisation of these principles and characteristics about how they can be implemented in a LRPG scenario are detailed. As an illustration, the game principles selected are used to describe an example of LRPG scenario. To conclude, the paper discusses the future outlook for the use of these elements in the design process and the support environment.",

		"abstract": "Role-playing games (RPG's) use a variety of methods for rolling dice to add randomness to the game. In the simplest form, a small number of identical dice are rolled and added, but more advanced forms involve cumulative re-rolling of 6's, doubling the value of doubles, removing the lowest or highest result or counting the number of dice that are below a threshold, and many other weird and wonderful modifications. While die-roll programs and net-based die-roll servers exist, they can usually only handle the simplest form of die-rolls. This paper describes Roll, a simple functional language for defining how dice are rolled. Such definitions are then used to emulate die-rolls or make probability calculations. We describe two different semantics for Roll: One that corresponds to randomly rolling the dice and one for calculating the probability distribution. We discuss implementation issues regarding the latter.",

Analysis is restricted to the rules of these games; the behavioral components of role playing are not considered. Thus correlations are drawn between games of various genres, and comments are made on the strategies of so-called universal role-playing systems. Final comments concern the recursive nature of play within role-playing games and the dialectic of play.",

		"abstract": "H.P. Lovecraft's short-story “The Call of Cthulhu”, published in 1928 in an issue of Weird Tales, was paramount for the evolution of what is known today as Science Fiction. By means of applying Gothic fiction tropes in his narratives, together with cosmic entities from outer space, Lovecraft is undoubtedly a pioneer in the xenofiction genre. Despite his unsuccessful career as a writer, both setting and lore surrounding Lovecratf's oeuvre eventually became popular in the late twentieth century, originating other works of fiction, as well as games, following the same style. The concept of role-playing game has its roots in the 1930s popular parlor game Jury Box. However, it was only in 1974, after Dungeons & Dragons was published, that the concept became widespread. Like any other games, from the simplest to the most complex, role-playing games have rules that define the conditions of victory or defeat. However, there are certain peculiarities which make role-playing games different from conventional video games. These aspects are in fact elements which are intrinsically related to theatrics and dramatic expression, namely the narrator and the actor. This paper will examine the relationship between the concept of game and theatrics as well as the role of performative acts in this relationship. As such, Call of Cthulhu (1981), a tabletop role-playing game based on lovecraftian fictional lore and myths, will be used to counter Roger Caillois's statement in Man, Play and Games (1961) that 'A characteristic of play, in fact, is that it creates no wealth or goods, thus differing from work or art.' (Caillois 2001: 5). In order to do this, it will be demonstrated that, despite being a game, tabletop role-playing games in general, with particular emphasis on Call of Cthulhu, actually do create something of literary value.",

		"abstract": "Dice are used in many games, and often in fairly complex ways that make it difficult to unambiguously describe the dice-roll mechanism in plain language. Many role-playing games, such as Dungeons & Dragons, use a formalised notation for some instances of dice-rolls. This notation, once explained, make dice-roll descriptions concise and unambiguous. Furthermore, the notation has been used in automated tools for pseudo-random dice-rolling (typically used when playing over the Internet). This notation is, however, fairly limited in the types of dice-rolls it can describe, so most games still use natural language to describe rolls. Even Dungeons & Dragons use formal notation only for some of the dice-roll methods used in the game. Hence, a more complete notation is in this paper proposed, and a tool for pseudo-random rolls and (nearly) exact probability calculations is described. The notation is called \"Troll\", combining the initial of the Danish word for dice (\"terninger\") with the English word \"roll\". It is a development of the language Roll described in an earlier paper. The present paper describes the most important features of Troll and its implementation.",

		"abstract": "Most RPGs (role-playing games) use some sort of randomizer when resolving actions.\nMost often dice are used for this, but a few games use cards, rock-paperscissors\nor other means of randomization.\nThere are dozens of different ways dice have been used in RPGs, and we are\nlikely to see many more in the future. This is not an evolution from bad methods\nto better methods – there is no such thing as a perfect dice-roll system suitable for\nall games (though there are methods that are suitable for none). But how will a\ndesigner be able to decide which of the existing dice-roll method is best suited for\nhis game, or when to invent his own?\nThere is no recipe for doing this – it is in many ways an art. But like any art,\nthere is an element of craft involved. This paper will attempt to provide some tools\nand observations that, hopefully, will give the reader some tools for the craftmanship\ninvolved in the art of choosing or designing dice-roll mechanisms for RPGs.",

Internet, le Web 2.0, et les autres dispositifs numériques sont pratiquement omniprésents dans notre société moderne. Les jeux, notamment les jeux de rôle, ne sont pas épargnés par cette imprégnation numérique puisque l’expérience de jeu des rôlistes est bien souvent augmentée et améliorée à travers ces nouveaux dispositifs. Ce travail se propose d’observer les nouveaux comportements et usages des rôlistes français dans leur pratique du jeu de rôle à l’ère du numérique grâce à un questionnaire soumis à de nombreux sujets (rôlistes). D’autre part, avec l’intégration des nouvelles technologies dans les univers ludiques, se pose la question de l’intégrité de l’essence du jeu de rôle dont les frontières sont souvent redéfinies.",

		"abstract": "This article presents the Wunderkammer-Gesamtkunstwerk (Wu-Ge) Model as a framework for the analysis and design of role-playing games. This framework is divided into four parts: Sub-Creation, Ludus, Performance, and Narrative. Sub-Creation is the world-building of the role-playing game. Ludus is the game mechanics and play rules. Performance is how the role-playing game is performed by the players. And Narrative is the storyline of the role-playing game. The model seeks to connect rather than tear these four parts and does this by the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk which means that indeed all the parts should work together as a whole work of art. Another concept is the Wunderkammer which means cabinet of curiosities. In this context the role-playing game is seen as a Wunderkammer and every item, concept, or idea put into this Wunderkammer is somehow changed by the relation to the other curiosities of the Wunderkammer. Furthermore, the Wu-Ge Model presents a structure based on two dichotomies: Concrete vs. Abstract and Action vs. Contemplation. Performance and Narrative belong to the Concrete, while Ludus and Sub-Creation belong to the Abstract. Performance and Ludus belong to Action, while Sub-Creation and Narrative belong to Contemplation. This means that the role-playing game wavers between the abstract and the concrete and between active and contemplative states. The aim of the article is to show how this knowledge can be used to not only analyse role-playing games but use it as a way to design role-playing games as well. The Wu-Ge Model helps define role-playing games and understand how they work as Wunderkammer and Gesamtkunstwerk.",

La fiction, en jeu de rôle, n'existe tout simplement pas.\n\nEt, finalement, lorsque l'idée même de fiction disparait, on découvre une nouvelle définition du jeu de rôle, beaucoup plus en accord avec la pratique que nous en avons.

Different objects and interaction modalities such as surface displays, tangible devices or interactive rooms are used for the augmentation of TTRPG. Still, usage of wearable devices and movement-based gameplay in such games is a rather underexplored area although they have a potential for enhancing the player experience according to the previous studies. To delve into this area, we developed a new interactive environment comprised of arm-worn devices and an augmented die. These devices, together with a new role-playing game system, facilitate movement-based gameplay which encourage players to enact their characters with their bodies. In this paper, we explained the specifications of this gaming environment and our demonstration setting.",

		"abstract": "Role-playing games can allow for extreme creative freedom where world building is concerned. In this sense, they inherit much of their structure from Tolkien’s idea of sub-creation. However, along with this creative freedom, RPGs contain rote rules and restrictions that must be followed. This paradox creates an intrinsic tension that players are forced to deal with. Rather than casting off restrictions, or punishing players that do not submit, gamers need to understand the purpose and necessity of rules, and be empathetic towards other players when they have difficulty following the dictates of a gaming manual. If these principles are followed, then true sub-creation can take place, and players can enter fully into a secondary world.",

		"abstract": "My essay is premised on the observation that while canonical theories of fantastic genre fiction (fantasy, science fiction, horror) proposed by critics such as Tzetvan Todorov and Darko Suvin center on epistemic aporia, most recent examples in popular culture reject fundamental difference, alterity, and the unknown in favor of postmodern play within a limited set of generic conventions. I argue that today, tabletop roleplaying game systems (RPGs) provide a superior hermeneutic for understanding how the fantasy genre operates in mass culture than does traditional genre theory. After providing a brief overview of the historical development of fantasy gaming out of wargaming and mass market fantasy literature in the 1970s, I show how RPGs formalized fantasy’s generic tropes into a modular system that enabled participants to produce fictions across and between genres. Through a reading of Poul Anderson’s use of the “multiverse” trope in his novel Three Hearts and Three Lions, the notion that reality consists of an infinite number of interconnected worlds, I argue RPGs completed a reorientation toward the fantastic begun by mass-market fantasy literature. Epistemological concerns, distinctions between fantastic genres, and individual authorship are de-emphasized in favor of established formal conventions, a shift which encourages a participatory model of consumption and ease of transmission across diverse media. I then use the HBO adaptation of George R. R. Martin’s Game of Thrones novels as an example of how this paradigmatic shift in the fantastic has moved beyond the niche markets of fantasy fiction and roleplaying games to manifest itself today as a hegemonic cultural norm.",

		"abstract": "Le jeu de rôle sur table a plus de quarante ans et ce n’est qu’aujourd’hui qu’il entame sa première révolution technologique. Appuyée d’une enquête qualitative par questionnaires conduite sur les réseaux sociaux du Québec, cette recherche confirme une opinion favorable et un virage déjà amorcé vers l’incorporation de périphériques et de logiciels autour de la table de jeu de rôle. Seuls le jeu distanciel et les tables virtuelles font moins consensus, eux qui amenuisent le contact humain et le rapport à l’objet tangible, ou qui rapprochent le jeu de rôle sur table un peu trop près du jeu vidéo.\n \n Ce mémoire analyse les tensions entre jeu et récit à l’intérieur de l’écosystème social et observe comment ces systèmes expérientiels interdépendants sont affectés par le choix et la manipulation des dispositifs technologiques qui sont introduits. Il place le designer industriel orienté vers l’utilisateur comme un maître de jeu 2.0 qui se sert de l’objet numérique pour se rapprocher de l’humain.\n \nPen and paper roleplaying is more than forty years old and it undertakes its first technological revolution only now. Building on a qualitative survey conducted over Québec social media, this research confirms a shift toward using digital hardware and software in roleplaying games and a positive opinion in general about them. Only long distance play sessions with virtual tabletops garner less extensive agreement, where human contact and emotional relationship with dice and miniatures are hampered, or because they bring tabletop roleplaying too closely to video games.\n \n This master’s degree thesis investigates the tension between game and story inside a social ecosystem and observes how interlinked experiential systems are affected by choosing technological devices. It situates the user-centered industrial designer as a game master 2.0 that wields digital objects to get closer to human players.",

Board games, ﬁrst-person shooters, and real-time strategy games have well-deﬁned win conditions and rely on strong feedback from a simulated environment. Text adventures require natural language understanding to progress through the game but still have an underlying simulated environment. In this paper, we propose tabletop roleplaying games as a challenge due to an inﬁnite action space, multiple (collaborative) players and models of the world, and no explicit reward signal. We present an approach for reinforcement learning agents that can play tabletop roleplaying games.",

		"abstract": "The connection that players can feel toward their characters in pen-and-paper roleplaying games is a known phenomenon that has been previously studied and is recognized among roleplaying enthusiasts. Pen-and-paper roleplaying games are a complex form of games, with three distinct frames which are ludological, social, and diegetic (also called narrative). The frames are different aspects of the game as well as the base of different motivations for players, who value the frames in a varied degree. The goal of this thesis is to examine if in-game choices based on the diegetic frame in contrast to the ludological frame are correlated with the player/character connection. The method used for data collection is distribution of a quantitative questionnaire on the internet, spread to Swedish roleplayers through social media and associations tied to SVEROK. With their answers, the analysis identifies correlations between the player/character connection and the three frames of pen-and-paper roleplaying games, as well as other correlations noted in the data analysis. The literature revolves around the two core concepts; the player/character connection and the three frames of roleplaying games. The result shows that diegetic choices in contrast to ludological are weakly correlated with the player/character connection.",

This paper presents a case study where TFRPGs were used to generate and collect data for maps of belief environments using fiction co-created by multiple small groups of online tabletop gamers. The affordances of TFRPGs allowed us to collect repeatable, targeted data in online field conditions. These data not only included terms that allowed us to build our maps, but also to explore nuanced ethical problems from a situated, collaborative perspective.",

It was noticed that the ability to acquire trustworthy information can make the player’s strategy improve exponentially depending on the rate of information acquirement.",

		"abstract": "This paper tries to solve the problem where automated character creation for Tabletop RPGs is completely random and does not fully pleases certain players, especially those that have difficulty in being creative and adapting characters to their personal tastes. To accomplish that, the usage of a Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) was proposed, in conjunction with the user's input (positive or negative) during generations, to create characters focused on having traits that are catered to each individual's taste. The generated traits are \"Race\", \"Class\", \"Size\", \"Visual Trait\", \"Personality\" and \"Quirk\". The fitness calculation for each individual was made using trait tables with weights previously defined by the programmer, and posteriorly by the user's evaluation of the characters during execution. The project was made using the Unity game engine with C# language, to take advantage of the tool's easy interface creation. It was produced as a phone application, for ease of distribution and general use. The application was tested with a variety of users, and the results, presented in the form of graphs, indicate that the rejection rate was almost null, with the great majority of users recognizing the gradual improvement of suggestions between generations, and evaluating positively the characters generated by the algorithm.",

In this paper, we argue that TTRPG design can usefully be viewed as procedural content generator design. We present several case studies linking key concepts from PCG research -- including possibility spaces, expressive range analysis, and generative pipelines -- to key concepts in TTRPG design. We then discuss the implications of these relationships and suggest directions for future work uniting research in TTRPGs and PCG.",

		"abstract": "This article explores the digitization of Swedish pen-and-paper role-playing games through the inflamed online discussions in the role-playing community that followed in its wake; discussions that in some cases resist the very idea of Digital in an age where Digital has become synonymous with ubiquitous progress and efficiency. The case in question focuses on Riotminds, a Swedish RPG publishing company that in 2010, in one broad stroke, transformed and converged all their analogue printed products into a single, online subscription service. Drawing on a general theoretical framework of materiality and (cultural) practice, the purpose of this article is to investigate the effects of digitization by asking: What does this particular instance of technological transformation and expressions of resistance reveal about materiality and the ongoing tensions between what constitutes meaningful digital and analogue immersive experiences? The results contribute to a critical, materialist perspective on digitization that encompasses both Digital’s virtues and challenges in terms of the digital transformation of physical practices and physical space. In other words, forwarding an understanding of digitalization as an intricate aesthetic shift, where identified analog sensibilities are converted into digital sensibilities, and its consequences for creating meaningful gaming experiences on behalf of the user (or player).",

No longer limited to simply reading books or watching movies, gamers came together to collaboratively and interactively build and explore new realms. Based on four years of interviews and game recordings from locations spanning the United States, this book offers a journey that explores how role-playing games use a combination of free-form imagination and tightly constrained rules to experience those realms. By developing our understanding of the fantastic worlds of role-playing games, this book also offers insight into how humans come together and collaboratively imagine the world around us.",

Cette expression, utilisée jusque dans les jeux de rôle contemporains, pose la question de la possibilité d’analyser le contenu de ces produits à l’aune de travaux scientifiques portant sur les mythes et les mythologies. Le présent article propose d’étudier le « mythe de Cthulhu » sous l’angle des théories de la réception des mythes proposées par Hans Blumenberg, afin de comprendre la diffusion des ressources auxquelles il renvoie. L’usage de ces références contribue à la mise en scène de l’horreur et rend ainsi possible ses appropriations ludiques en instaurant une distance avec le contenu des représentations. En effet, les mécanismes des jeux, tout comme les représentations de l’horreur, donnent une forme concrète à l’indicible et réduisent alors sa part suggestive.",

There are some approaches that try to tackle it, using strategies and heuristic rules that can combine on the fly the previously designed author material with the run-time decisions of the interactor. Interactive Narrative is a relatively new field and it is difficult to find formal studies that shows how to create this kind of art. Our proposal is based on the theoretical study of tabletop Role-Playing Games and it involves the practical implementation of those ideas for managing the interaction in a simple text adventure game. Game Masters are the best models we have found in real life for designing and directing interactive stories. In this paper we transfer their player modeling, their rules for interaction management and their improvising algorithms from the real world to a new Interactive Storytelling system.",

The goal of the application is to allow users to generate non-player characters, locations, and encounters whenever needed.  This functionality will be most useful to the Dungeon Master, the person in charge of running the game.  Dungeon Masters spend many hours outside of regular play time preparing for each game session and must improvise when the players do something unexpected during the session.  Chaotic Creations will ease the burden of the Dungeon Master by allowing him to spend less time preparing for a session and reducing the stress of creating game elements on the spot.  The application focuses on simplicity and ease of use to not slow down gameplay if used during a session.",

We argue that our results stress the impact of convergence culture (Jenkins, 2006) in understanding D&D play.",

		"abstract": "Currently, barriers to access are high for new or inexperienced designers in the fields of tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) design. TTRPGs remain a relatively unexplored design space, to the detriment of designers and system homebrewers– those who wish to modify existing TTRPG systems, rather than write new ones. A useful solution to this issue is to compose a pattern language representative of these systems. A pattern language provides a useful blueprint for designers of complex design systems, simplifying the TTRPG design process. In this thesis, we create a conceptual language which presents a simple-to-understand method of developing a TTRPG’s core elements alongside a set of pre-defined options and goals. This pattern language will then be simulated by an application developed within the JavaScript engine Blockly, as both a demonstration and as a tool with which designers can write systems. This tool, which we have named Assemble, will demonstrate how designers could benefit from utilizing pattern languages in computer-aided design contexts for TTRPG systems.",

Rulebooks created for their needs are characteristic and unique publications, mainly due to their speciﬁc form and the goals they pursue, among others with the help of illustrations. For the needs of the article, thematic, quantitative and aesthetic analyses of basic rulebooks from the main publishing line of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons series were given. Based on the collected data, the characteristics of the trends and regularities of the aspects of the illustration were examined to draw attention to the potentially new ﬁeld of bibliological research. According to the author, these publications are an intriguing element of the Polish and global world of the book which is worth exploring.",

		"abstract": "This project aims to compose background music in real-time for tabletop role-playing games. To accomplish this goal, we propose a system called MTG that listens to players' speeches in order to recognize the context of the current scene and generate background music to match the scene. A speech recognition system is used to transcribe players' speeches to text and a supervised learning algorithm detects when scene transitions take place. In its current version, a scene transition occurs whenever the emotional state of the narrative changes. Moreover, the background music is not generated, but selected based on its emotion from a library of hand-authored pieces. As future work, we plan to generate the background music considering the current scene context and the probability of scene transition. We also consider to retrieve more information from the narrative to detect scene transitions, such as the scene's location and time of the day as well as actions taken by characters.",

This study specifically looks at the game Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition and included interviews with six participants on how they balanced the collaborative narrative environment and expressing creativity while working within a system with extensive rules and guidelines for how the game functions.\nWhile participants did acknowledge that the rules were important, the rules themselves function more as paratexts, or guidelines. They functioned to create a consistent, understandable environment within which to create a narrative, but participants recognized that if these guidelines hamper the enjoyment or flow of the game and story they could be changed or ignored for the players’ benefit. Furthermore, players were more likely to break the rules or allow others to do so if there was a creative and interesting narrative purpose, as it was important to allow all players to have agency and input in the narrative and to ensure that the story itself was enjoyable for all involved.",

		"abstract": "During the 2020 Corona virus crisis in Lombardy, a \"stranger time,\" social distancing made it impossible to a group of players to meet and play their favourite role playing game around a table. The game continued through a mobile messaging app, which allowed each participant to roll a standard (6-sided) die that the entire group could see (but not to roll more exotic dice). This lead to the research of variant rules that only required these rolls on part of the players, and we were delighted to discover that the legendary 1971 Blackmoor campaign of Dave Arneson was played with standard dice only. In fact, the primary combat system of the original edition of Dungeons & Dragons by Gygax and Arneson (1974) borrowed from the 2d6-based Chainmail of Gygax and Perren (1971). The present paper regroups the 2d6 algorithms that were playtested in Barrowmaze, an \"old school megadungeon\" of Greg Gillespie (2014).",

		"abstract": "Tabletop games such a Dungeons & Dragons allow players the ability to create a make belief world in which other players can be a part of. Tabletop games mainly depend on the players imagination, which is both its greatest feature and flaw. The frustration comes with not having shared vision for the word, so players typically buy figurines and maps. Our solution is an app that uses augmented reality to bring tabletop gaming to life. Players will be able to view the characters and maps of their story in a more interactive and immersive way. As players view the game from their phone camera, they will be able to see 3D trees, dragons, and their own personalized characters standing on the table, swaying and breathing as if they were in the room with them. Parties can be built to allow friends who are also playing the game to be able to see the same objects from their own distinct perspective. Not only do they have the option to choose through a selection of provided 3D models, but also be able to upload their own 3D models to view in the real world through their phone cameras.",

		"abstract": "Landscapes evolve. Forests turn into cities, rivers change course and even mountains slowly erode. Perhaps it stands to reason then, that the landscapes of the fantastic evolve as well. In recent times, the evolution of the imaginary worlds found in speculative works of fiction appears to favour diversity and inclusiveness, keeping in touch with wider societal trends. This transition in fantastic chronotopes is extensively chronicled in the genre of Tabletop Role-Playing Games, or TRPGs for short. The present paper aims to examine the evolution of fantastical landscapes within the very influential TRPG genre through the combined framework of narrative and cultural theories. The settings of the most successful TRPGs, Dungeons and Dragons and World of Darkness, will serve as examples. The results will provide valuable insights into how and why the worlds of speculative fiction change over time, often in response to wider societal change",

		"abstract": "In this essay I discuss how realism operates to constrain games, especially role-playing games, that take place in a fantasy milieu. The design of these games involves tradeoffs between two values, which are sometimes labeled “realism” and “playability”. These values are ordinarily understood to be wholly independent and competing. Using resources drawn from John Rawls's conception of political theory as a search for a “realistic utopia”, I show how these values can instead be under-stood as aspects of the more general value of creating and conceiving a realistic fantasy through the medium of game play. I also explain how realism operates differently as a constraint on tabletop role-playing games from how it operates in realistic video games and live-action role-playing.",

		"abstract": "The process of worldbuilding in games often forgoes the aspect of connecting the setting with the game’s mechanics. Skipping this vital process often leaves games with beautiful, but ultimately empty and meaningless worlds, and abstract, disconnected mechanics. The objective of this thesis was to study and present ways to intertwine the mechanics and the story of a game.\nThe thesis studied several methods of worldbuilding to create a step-by-step process of worldbuilding, and used the set approach to construct a fictional fantasy world as a campaign setting for Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game, building each part with applying the same rules in layers. This fantasy world was then used as a basis for an adventure module, built using similar process. The aim of the process was to build a game world that would link the story aspects of the world with the mechanics of the game as tightly as possible.\nThe end result product of the thesis was Working Title: Dream Stone, an adventure module for 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. The adventure takes place in a fictional world created using the process detailed in this thesis.\nHowever, more time and resources would have been needed to complete the worldbuilding process in its entirety, as well as to refine the product. Additionally, more playtesting would have been required to gain full understanding of the functionality of the adventure. Despite this, the final product managed to produce valuable information regarding the processes of worldbuilding in games.",

		"abstract": "After hiding it for many years, I have a confession to make.\nThroughout middle school and high school my friends and I would gather almost every weekend, spending hours using numbers, probability, and optimization to build models that we could use to simulate almost anything.\nThat’s right. My big secret is simple. I was a high school mathematical modeler.\nOf course, our weekend mathematical models didn’t bear any direct relationship to the models we explored in our mathematics and science classes. You would probably not even recognize our regular gatherings as mathematical exercises. If you looked into the room, you’d see a group of us gathered around a table, scribbling on sheets of paper, rolling dice, eating pizza, and talking about dragons, magical spells, and sword fighting. So while I claim we were engaged in mathematical modeling, I suspect that very few math classes built models like ours. After all, how many math teachers have constructed or had their students construct a mathematical representation of a dragon, a magical spell, or a swordfight? And yet, our role-playing games (RPGs) were very much mathematical models of reality — certainly not the reality of our everyday experience, but a reality nonetheless, one intended to simulate a particular kind of world. Most often for us this was the medieval, high-fantasy world of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), but we also played games with science fiction or modern-day espionage settings. We learned a lot about math, mythology, medieval history, teamwork, storytelling, and imagination in the process. And, when existing games were inadequate vehicles for our imagination, we modified them or created new ones. In doing so, we learned even more about math.\nNow that I am a mathematics professor, I find myself reflecting on those days as a “fantasy modeler” and considering various questions. What is the relationship between my two interests of fantasy games and mathematics? Does having been a gamer make me a better mathematician or modeler? Does my mathematical experience make me a better gamer? These different aspects of my life may seem mostly unconnected; indeed, the “nerd” stereotype is associated with both activities, but despite public perception, the community of role-players includes many people who are not scientifically-minded. So we cannot say that role-players like math, or math-lovers role-play, because “that is simply what nerds do.” To get at the deeper question of how mathematics and role-playing are related, we first need to look at the processes of gaming, game designing, and modeling",

		"abstract": "Prior research has highlighted opportunities for technology to better support the tabletop game experience in offline and online settings, but little work has focused on the social aspect of tabletop gaming. We investigated the social and collaborative aspects of tabletop gaming in the unique context of “social distancing” during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic to shed light on the experience of remote tabletop gaming. With a multi-method qualitative approach (including digital ethnography and in-depth interviews), we empirically studied how people appropriate existing technologies and adapt their offline practices to play tabletop games remotely. We identify three themes that describe people's game and social experience during remote play: creating a shared tabletop environment (shared space), enabling a collective understanding (shared information and awareness), and facilitating a communal temporal experience (shared time). We reflect on challenges and design opportunities for a better experience in the age of remote collaboration.",

It shows that the narrative mechanics so clearly identifiable in games are increasingly used (and abused) in politics and social life. They have »many faces«, displays and interfaces. They occur as texts, recipes, stories, dramas in three acts, movies, videos, tweets, journeys of heroes, but also as rewarding stories in games and as narratives in society - such as a career from rags to riches, the concept of modernity or market economy. Below their surface, however, narrative mechanics are a particular type of motivational design - of game mechanics.",

While ‘playing with’ usually refers to the specific objects used as toys and ‘playing at’ to the roles assumed in such play, examining play situations from the perspective of the make-believe theory of representation (prop theory) suggests a specific relationship between these two aspects of playing. By examining which props are being used in any given play situation, and comparing their metaphorical position in the foreground or background of the imaginary game being played, parallels and distinctions between different kinds of play can be explored and contrasted. The paper offers a phenomenology of imaginative play that helps to clarify exactly what we are playing with when we engage in any kind of imaginings, whether with toys, games, or stories.",

Where traditional role-play experiences deliver meaning through player and Game Master group interaction, Westworld provides its guests with violent escapism, sexual fantasy, and nostalgic indulgence. Within the series, the Westworld park presents itself as a combination of two aspects of tabletop role-playing game: sandbox format and Live Action Role-play (LARP). Within the role-play experience, the cultivation of motivation on the part of the Game Master entices players to undertake or follow particular narrative threads. Gameplay was designed to cultivate certain personality traits and instincts. Herein the game's rules, style and structures “influence a user's behavior without forcing the change” - essentially enacting education through restriction. In the case of role-play games, these restrictions are less over by the narrative nature of the game.",

		"abstract": "Research suggests that game-based education encourages motivation and drives academic progress. Role-playing games integrate challenge, narrative, and collaboration within the overarching theme of character and player development. The review article delves into literature around the international use of role-playing games in education. The findings from multiple qualitative and quantitative research studies are analysed to identify trends and gaps in the research. The findings support the suggestion that role-playing games are being used to develop collaboration and communication skills, and that their educational potential increases when paired with a formal debrief period. Limitations to the current use of role-playing games are identified as varied levels of student and teacher experience with games and small sample sizes of existing studies.",

		"abstract": "This article examines West End Games’ Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, first published in 1987, and its foundational role in the worldbuilding process of the Star Wars franchise (1977–). In producing the game, West End Games contributed significantly to defining and organizing the storyworld, refining and expanding the scope of Star Wars by integrating some earlier transmedial extensions while excluding others. Coming at an early point in the franchise’s history, before Lucasfilm exerted as much control over its licensees, The Roleplaying Game offers an opportunity to examine the role that licensed game designers can play as architects and gatekeepers of transmedia worldbuilding, codifying what is and is not remembered within the storyworld. The Roleplaying Game has often been reduced to a footnote in both the popular and academic history of Star Wars transmedia, but beyond adapting the Galaxy Far, Far Away to a setting for imaginative tabletop roleplaying, The Roleplaying Game is also a foundational document for the last three decades of the Star Wars franchise, serving as the early ‘story bible’ for the Expanded Universe, the interconnected network of Star Wars paratexts codified by the licensing department of Lucasfilm during the 1990s. The hundreds of Star Wars novels, comics, games and other transmedia productions that came with the franchise’s dramatic rebirth in the 1990s bear the stamp of the worldbuilding labour of West End Games.",

		"abstract": "Licensed games—analog or digital games that are made under contract using pre-existing intellectual properties—bring together the narrative trajectories of their storyworld, the production histories of their creation, the affective traces of their fandoms, and the interpersonal dynamics of their play. This dissertation examines the intersection of the industrial practices of licensing, the textual properties of transmediality, and the creative process of worldbuilding through the lens of licensed games. Licensed games have frequently been dismissed as derivative and overly commercial; my aim is to embrace the redundancies and contradictions of licensed games. Licensing, in which owners of intellectual property sell the rights for use of an IP for a limited period, provides the framework but not the boundaries of these ludic paratexts that stage a complex negotiation of popular storyworlds and fannish affect.  \n \nIn this dissertation, I explore how three different popular storyworlds are built and shared, explored and negotiated, experienced and felt. The first chapter examines how games have contributed to the growth and continuation of the Star Wars universe. In the second chapter, I survey how the design of rules in games based on the A Song of Ice and Fire / Game of Thrones franchise inflects and influences engagement with Westeros. And in my final chapter, I explore what I call a post-licensed game, Warhammer 40,000: Conquest, and the frequently fraught communal process of supporting a card game once its licensing and production have ended.  \n \nThese licensed games provide richly textured case studies of the negotiation between industrial stakeholders, texts, and fans. Utilizing a combination of textual analysis, participant observation and interviews with players, I argue that licensed games are a fertile medium through which popular brands, franchises, and storyworlds are productively transmediated. How these games draw upon the subjective and affective dimensions of our investment in popular storyworlds reveals much about game design, media franchising, and the creative processes of worldbuilding inherent to both. Licensed games allow us to play in a storyworld, and their modes of engagements foreground the playful ways we experience and understand the transmedially expansive franchises that dominate popular culture.",

There is evidence that clinicians have difficulty treating individuals experiencing social anxiety and there is need for intervention strategies that lower treatment barriers. There has been scant research recognizing the use of table-top role-playing games to incorporate when treating social anxiety. The current manuscript describes a year-long group using Dungeons and Dragons in a therapeutic setting and explores perceptions from participants who experienced this group. Core concepts of the model and lessons learned from the developers are described for clinicians who hope to incorporate such a model. Participants described increased confidence in social situations, particularly with boundaries or making mistakes. Secondly, the skills practiced in the game were transferred into real-world experiences. Implications for future research and limitations were described.",

Aihetta on tutkittu tähän mennessä kohtalaisen vähän ja tutkimuskirjallisuudessa on selvä aukko. Tästä huolimatta pöytäroolipelien pelaajamäärät kasvavat joka vuosi räjähdysmäisesti. Tämä osoittaa, että ilmiö on tutkimisen arvoinen myös kielenoppimisen näkökulmasta.\n\nTässä laadullisessa tutkimuksessa toteutettiin kolmen pelikerran mittainen pöytäroolipelikokeilu neljälle korkeakouluopiskelijalle, joilla ei ollut suoraa kokemusta pöytäroolipeleistä. Nämä osallistujat myös kokivat omat englannin kielen taitonsa korkeintaan kohtalaisiksi. Kaikki pelikerrat videokuvattiin, ja jokaista osallistujaa haastateltiin erikseen joka pelikerran jälkeen. Pääsääntöisenä aineistona tutkimuksessa toimi tallennetut haastattelut pelikertojen jälkeen. Aineistosta oli tarkoituksena selvittää osallistujien näkemyksiä pöytäroolipelien soveltuvuudesta englannin oppimiseen ja niiden sisällyttämisestä perinteiseen luokkahuoneopetukseen. Aineisto analysoitiin pääsääntöisesti laadullisen sisällönanalyysin metodeilla.\n\nTutkimuksen päätulokset osoittavat, että pöytäroolipelien pelaaminen englanniksi toimii hyvin englannin oppimisen keinona, johtuen etenkin kielenkäytön monipuolisuudesta ja pelaajien yhteistyöstä pelin aikana. Yllättävää oli kuitenkin, että osallistujat ilmaisivat pettymyksensä perinteiseen englannin luokkahuoneopetukseen Suomessa, johtuen etenkin vähäisestä improvisaation määrästä. Pöytäroolipelit voisivat paikata näitä puutteita, mutta etenkin nykyiset isot luokkahuonekoot ovat esteenä näiden pelien sujuvaan sisällyttämiseen.\n\nJohtuen pöytäroolipelien rajusta kasvusta, tulisi aihetta tutkia vielä suuremmilla osallistujamäärillä, jotta aiheesta saataisiin kattavampaa tutkimustietoa.",

This elusiveness of value creates a challenge for designers to gauge users’ value preferences, which are personal, contextual and abstract. We propose deliberation as a process to operationalise design for elicitation, reflection and value formation, using Live Action Role Play (LARP). The paper demonstrates how our deliberative LARP precipitates the otherwise ethereal data values to unfold in a social setting. We argue that engaging people in reflecting on and playing out their own value formation offers designers more powerful insights to address complex challenges of data-driven societies. We report on our findings that agency and negotiability are key to transcend the politics of preferences in data practices and thus enhance acceptability.",

		"abstract": "COVID-19 has already taken over millions of lives and has brought the entire world to a halt. It has been a great challenge for teachers and students alike, especially for children. The area of education has reimagined itself. Children began to actively learn through the screens of their computers, tablets, and some, even cellphones. This article brings an experience report about strategies involving the principals and themes of Role-Playing Games used for online classes of English aimed at Brazilian children around the ages of five to nine years old. Role-playing games (at times also spelled as roleplaying games; abbreviated to RPG or RPGs) are games in which the people participating in them (players) assume the roles of characters within a fictional setting. The idea of using RPG strategies to retain the attention of children while teaching from afar, via Zoom, Skype or any other platform that allows the direct interaction between educator and student comes from RPGs’ incredible capacity of transporting the mind of children to a different space, a space of attention and entertainment. As perceived by Tolomei (2017) and also shown in this experience report, motivation and engagement are enhanced through game mechanics. The technique also fulfills the need for human relationships, which has been taken away by COVID-19.",

However, this implies that to enjoy the classical tabletop role-playing experience, the human factor is needed in its design.",

Toutefois, depuis 2010, de nouveaux travaux abordant ces questions ont vu le jour dans le monde anglo-saxon, en prenant pour objet d’étude plus spécifiquement les jeux numériques. Après un état de l’art sur ces questions, cet article introductif propose un ensemble de pistes de réflexion pour aborder ce domaine qui connaît un renouveau d’intérêt : emprunts culturels, formes de syncrétismes, mises en scène d’éléments religieux liés aux processus de structuration, stratégies identitaires ludiques et religions, polémiques religieuses et paniques morales et, enfin, porosités des frontières entre activités ludiques et religieuses.",

		"abstract": "This paper presents a comparative study on two Tabletop Roleplaying Games, Dungeons & Dragons and Blades in the Dark. This paper takes a look at the narrative differences within the two systems. More specifically investigate if Blades in the Dark is more playerdriven than Dungeons & Dragons. The two tested as closely as possible and will be compared with each other. This is a close reading on the rules and player agency rather than a one-on-one comparison. The comparisons were made regarding the mechanics and narrative differences within the systems rather than quality of the story. This study was conducted by running two sessions, one for each system, played by separate groups with the same game scenario and premise. Meaning that the background for both games, character and plot for the session were the same. Comparisons were made by observing player decisions, situations that arose and the influence that the gamemasters had on the game. It was found that there is a clear difference between the two systems, this difference regarding whether the players were reacting to the gamemaster, or the other way round. In Dungeons & Dragons, it was observed that the players reacted and acted according to what the gamemaster explained and played out, whereas in Blades in the Dark it appeared to be the opposite. Here we found that it was the Gamemaster who was reactive to the players instead. The paper concluded that Blades in the Dark is the more player-driven system. This short study could later be built upon and used by game developers to keep in mind and plan their future game systems around. Taking these observations on emergent narrative in Tabletop Role-playing Games into account can be used to create more player-centric and player-driven games. Meaning that the players are more in influence and decisions to make in the story and game.",

The conception of such training was inspired by RPG games. Forty-seven undergraduate education students (mainly women) voluntarily participated in the presented research. The training was conducted in two forms—1-day meeting (8h) or four meetings 2h each (totaling also 8h). The effectiveness of training was evaluated with the use of two creativity tests – Urban & Jellen Test of Creative Thinking – Drawing Production (TCT-DP) and Kujawski Test of Creative Imagination (TCI). Comparison of post-test and pre-test results shows statistically significant increase of the results in TCT-DP and two of three TCI scales—fluency and originality.",

Research has now also shown that TRPG s – such as Dungeons and Dragons – provide a unique environment for the development of prosocial behaviours. There is an opportunity for researchers interested in political emotions and ideological performance to explore a community of collaborative storytelling where the altruism derided by philosophies of neoliberal economic rationalism is performed as a core value, with tangible outcomes for tolerance, generosity and well-being. As TRPG s become commonly accepted as part of the toolkit in both education and therapeutic contexts, they provide a new avenue of engagement for those interested in the development of prosocial values, community and social inclusion in the digital age.",

		"abstract": "Understanding data management in spatial data science is fundamentally important when ensuring a project’s data is appropriately collected, analyzed, stored, and communicated. However, these concepts are often introduced to learners through compliance (i.e., we do this because we are required to or it is the right thing to do), and as a result can mean learning experiences around spatial data management are viewed less than enthusiastically. Academic libraries are places where engaging learning experiences around spatial data management can be explored and implemented through unique pedagogical techniques. For example, activities teaching spatial data management in academic libraries through a popular culture lens can make these topics more approachable and reduce learning barriers. In this paper, I present three lesson plans for academic librarians which approach teaching spatial data management through popular culture. The following concepts are represented: (1) understanding spatial metadata through Dungeons & Dragons; (2) learning to write good documentation through drawing Pokémon; and (3) developing good file naming habits with 1980s album covers. Alongside the lesson plans, I provide a narrative outlining why popular culture pedagogy is a useful technique to spatial data management education to increase the inclusivity and engagement around geospatial learning experiences in academic libraries.",

		"abstract": "The trend of gamification holds a lot of potential for English language teaching and education in general. Given the variety of games available on the market today, it is imperative to consider each game genre separately for what it can offer to a particular class. This paper focuses on the genre of tabletop role-playing games and how the ELT classroom could profit from using their principles. The introduction of tabletop role playing games can positively impact on all four language skills, but the benefits stretch beyond this to sociolinguistic competence and promotion of a more relaxed atmosphere in the classroom. These positive aspects create a space which promotes learner-centeredness by motivating students to engage with the lesson through play. The paper also addresses the possible pitfalls of implementing tabletop role playing game principles and provides options for overcoming possible obstacles. Additionally, two observation studies are presented that show how the introduction of tabletop role-playing game principles can positively impact on the teaching and learning of English, one conducted in an after-school club and one in a class of university students of English. The former showcases how the environment shaped by tabletop role-playing games fosters the use of the target language. The latter provides us with insights into how students in an actual classroom respond to an activity which incorporates tabletop role-playing game principles. Both research studies support tabletop role playing games as positive additions to the arsenal of English language teaching activities.",

		"abstract": "The modern consumer has access to a massively complex entertainment world. Many of the products available reveal a visible movement of popular fantasy worlds between different media. This transmedia process creates a strong link between film, merchandising and games; with all of these mediums borrowing from each other. This borrowing takes various forms, from licensed adaptations to unofficial copying of ideas, settings and characters as well as exploiting the different aesthetics and techniques of different media. Much of the scholarship on transmedia concentrates on storytelling, where a single overarching narrative unfolds over several different media. This thesis will move away from storytelling to consider how culture producers borrow the aesthetics, narratives and fantasy worlds from other sources, including computer games. This borrowing happens because it enables them to use transmedia functionality to gain market share from an already established audience who have a vested interested in, and enthusiasm for, an established world. Most of this borrowing happens around specific genres – especially fantasy, science fiction and horror. These genres are particularly wide-ranging and emphasise the possibilities of worldbuilding, making then good sources for multi-media franchises. This thesis will examine examples from these genres to examine what elements are translated to a new medium, and what is discarded. This examination will help explain how and why different media and settings work in the way that they do.",

In this article, the structure and intensity of the verbal communication between players in three different types of multiplayer role-playing games are analyzed. Data is drawn from a series of empirical experiments covering: A) Console gaming; B) Multiple players in a conventional LAN-setup, and: C) non-digital tabletop gaming. The results indicate that there are distinct differences in the overall communication pattern between the three game setups. When players share a single screen they communicate more than when each person has their own monitor, indicating a direct effect of the representation of the game medium on player communication. Additionally, in the digital games, speech intensity varies as a function of the game content: Players communicate the most during non-stressful game segments, and the least during intensive combat scenes, although the latter does require extensive coordination. The implication of this result is that analysis of player communication has the potential to be used as symptoms of boredom or excitement.",

Pen-and-paper role-playing games (P&P RPG) are a concept known since the early 1970s. Since then, the genre has attracted a massive community of players while branching out into several genres and P&P RPG systems to choose from. Due to the highly interactive and dynamic nature of the game, a participants individual impact on narrative and interactive aspects of the game is extremely high. The diversity of scenarios within this context unfold a variety of players needs, as well as factors limiting and enhancing game-play. Companion offers an audio management workspace for creation and playback of soundscapes based on visual layouting. It supports interactive image presentation and map exploration which can incorporate input from any device providing TUIO tracking data. Additionally, a mobile app was developed to be used as a remote control for media activation on the desktop host.",

If the three dice all give the same result, another three dice are rolled and added to the total. This is continued until the three dice no longer match. We calculate the average result of the stochastic sum: 10 + 4/5. \nWe also consider a generalized dice rolling scheme where we roll an arbitrary number of dice with arbitrary number of sides. This generalization is motivated by various exotic dice that are used in many roleplaying games. We calculate the expectation, and how much it differs from the situation where we only roll the set of dice once, with no rerolling and adding. As the number of dice increases, or the number of sides the dice have increases, this difference approaches zero, unless there are two dice (with the number of sides increasing), in which case the difference approaches one.",

In order\nto help gifted children and adolescents develop and practice social and emotional self-regulation\nskills, we investigated the use of an Adlerian play therapy approach during pen-and-paper roleplaying\ngames. Additionally, we used Goffman’s (1961, 1974) social role identification and\ndistance to encourage participants to experiment with new identities. Herein, we propose a\npsychosocial model of interactions during role-playing games based on Goffman's theory and\nAdlerian play therapy techniques, and suggest that role-playing games are an effective way of\nintervening with gifted children and adolescents to improve their intra- and interpersonal skills.\nWe specifically targeted intrapersonal skills of exercising creativity, becoming self-aware, and\nsetting individual goals by raising participants’ awareness of their privately logical reasons for\nmaking decisions and their levels of social interest. We also targeted their needs and means of\nseeking significance in the group to promote collaboration and interaction skills with other gifted\npeers through role analysis, embracement, and distancing. We report results from a case study\nand conclude that role-playing games deserve more attention, both from researchers and clinical\npractitioners, because they encourage change while improving young clients' social and\nemotional development.",

All previous uncertainties or controversies relate to the issue of who is to speak for the parties involved. The last chapter in lieu of a conclusion ends this book by scrutinising what remains after playing: Knowledge through, for and of RPGs. What knowledge gain players by and for role-playing? Who decides what constitutes a role-playing game? How much involved are scholars of RPGs in the making of their object? The chapter wraps up with a summary of the ordering conflicts entangling the assemblage. It delivers a contingent sketch of the possibilities of role-playing games and the uncertainties revolving around their dynamics and ordering in Japan and beyond: The assemblage of role-playing is more than one and less than many.",

		"abstract": "This article presents a critical view of the concept of rules in game studies on the basis of a case study of role-playing across media. Role-playing in its traditional form is a complex activity including a game system and a number of communicative conventions where one player takes the role of the game manager in order to implement the rules and provide a world for the other players. In online role-playing games, a programmed system simulates the rule system as well as part of the game manager’s tasks, while the rest of the activity is up to the players to define. Some aspects may translate more or less unproblematically across media, others are transformed by the introduction of the programmed system. This reveals some important perspectives on the sort of rules that can be simulated in a programmed system and what this means to the concept of rules in game studies.",

This new medium has allowed the playing of games to become a digestible, consumable text for individuals to watch, enjoy, learn from, and analyze. Bridging the gap between the analog and the digital, actual play is changing and challenging our expectations of tabletop role-playing and providing a space for new scholarship. This edited collection of essays focuses on Dungeons and Dragons actual play and examines this phenomenon from a variety of different disciplinary approaches. Authors explore how to define actual play, how fans interact with and affect the narrative and gameplay of actual play, the diversity of gamers (or lack thereof) within actual play media, and how audiences can use actual play media for more than mere entertainment.",

		"abstract": "Since 1974, Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D) has existed on the fringes of popular culture alongside many other tabletop roleplaying games. In recent years, however, D&amp;D and other RPGs have emerged at the forefront of gaming culture. The allure of fantasy and magic draws players into creating and roleplaying characters in a mediated fantasy space through social interaction. Though largely untheorized, Dungeons &amp; Dragons has been examined through sociological and philosophical lenses, though these studies often ignore the performative aspects of the game itself.During gameplay, Dungeon Masters (DMs) often exploit sensory detail, music specifically, in order to encourage roleplay in their players. The fifth edition handbook of D&amp;D states that DMs can use “music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they might play in the game.” The following research explores the use of music within D&amp;D as it relates to the players’ ability to immerse themselves within the game, drawing on research in ludomusicology and applying a lens of reflexive and close ethnography. Additionally, this research explicates a growing popularity of D&amp;D on the internet through shows such as Critical Role and the live storytelling genre, as well as how it has altered ideas concerning the performance of voice. Based on interviews with players and observations of D&amp;D games in person and via online streaming services, this article asserts that music allows players to immerse themselves within the setting of the game, which in turn creates a form of participatory performance for both the players and the Dungeon Master.",

Because of the presence of the audience and the possibility of interactivity, there is potential for audiences to impact the narrative being told in the game. A series of interviews and first hand observations of Dungeons & Dragons livestream shows were conducted to create an understanding of current audience interactions and impacts. The results show a wide variety of ways that audience interactions profoundly impact the game’s narrative and the type of role they play in the creation of the story. This study then provides a basis for conversations around designing audience interaction to best align with the story and the collaborative narration process.",

The paper illustrates how youth critique and resist unjust societal norms while simultaneously envisioning queer utopian futures. Using a queer theory framework, the authors consider how youth performed disidentifications and queer futurity. Design/methodology/approach This study is a discourse analysis of approximately 85 hours of audio collected over one year. Findings Youth engaged in deconstructive critique, disidentifications and queer futurity in powerful enactments of critical literacies that involved simultaneous resistance, subversion, imagination and hope as youth envisioned queer utopian world-building through their fantasy storytelling. Youth acknowledged the injustice of the present while radically envisioning a utopian future. Originality/value This study offers an empirical grounding for critical literacies centered in queer theory and explores how youth engage with critical literacies in collaboratively co-authored texts. The authors argue that queering critical literacies potentially moves beyond deconstructive critique while simultaneously opening spaces for resistance, imagination and utopian world-making through linguistic and narrative-based tools.",

		"abstract": "This paper explores the connections between utopian approaches in performance studies, queer strategies for community building, and the world-creation tools made available by tabletop “pen and paper” role-playing games (TRPGs). Particularly, drawing on the varied modes of reality offered by each of the above, and they ways they can support experimentation with alternative societies, relationships, and political ideologies.Beginning with a contextual analysis of Dungeons & Dragons, it outlines the structure, history, and current iterations of tabletop roleplaying games, towards an understanding of how the form can be used in the construction of playful, microcosmic utopias sensitive to queer experiences of solidarity within marginalisation. To illustrate this usage, Avery Alder’s queer, post-apocalyptic TRPG Dream Askew (2019) is later explored as a particularly appropriate case study to illustrate this usage.The paper goes on to look at how the conception of Utopia as a world apart (as in Thomas Moore’s ‘No Place’), the establishing of a ‘Magic Circle’ (coined by Johan Huizinga) as a zone of shifted possibility in both game and performance contexts, and the genres of science fiction and speculative fiction, can be used together to facilitate a form of collaborative storytelling. This type of storytelling is noted as being politically significant in the ways it consolidates the roles of performer and spectator, engaging with Augusto Boal’s critiques of passive spectatorship, and framing of performance as possible “rehearsal for revolution” [1974(2008): 135].",

		"abstract": "The story of the arcane table-top game that became a pop culture phenomenon and the long-running legal battle waged by its cocreators.\n\nWhen Dungeons & Dragons was first released to a small hobby community, it hardly seemed destined for mainstream success—and yet this arcane tabletop role-playing game became an unlikely pop culture phenomenon. In Game Wizards, Jon Peterson chronicles the rise of Dungeons & Dragons from hobbyist pastime to mass-market sensation, from the initial collaboration to the later feud of its creators, Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. As the game's fiftieth anniversary approaches, Peterson—a noted authority on role-playing games—explains how D&D and its creators navigated their successes, setbacks, and controversies.\n\nPeterson describes Gygax and Arneson's first meeting and their work toward the 1974 release of the game; the founding of TSR and its growth as a company; and Arneson's acrimonious departure and subsequent challenges to TSR. He recounts the “Satanic Panic” accusations that D&D was sacrilegious and dangerous, and how they made the game famous. And he chronicles TSR's reckless expansion and near-fatal corporate infighting, which culminated with the company in debt and overextended and the end of Gygax's losing battle to retain control over TSR and D&D.\n\nWith Game Wizards, Peterson restores historical particulars long obscured by competing narratives spun by the one-time partners. That record amply demonstrates how the turbulent experience of creating something as momentous as Dungeons & Dragons can make people remember things a bit differently from the way they actually happened.",

		"abstract": "In tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs), game masters (GMs) facilitate creating an improvisational shared story, responding in real time to the actions that players take and the things that they want to see in the world. In order to examine the process by which GMs co-create such player-driven narratives, we conduct interviews with GMs about their process preparing for and running TTRPG campaigns. We qualitatively code these interviews in order to synthesize a list of techniques GMs can use to move the story forward. We also compare these interviews to other sources of advice for GMing in sourcebooks and essays. Using the GMing techniques found through this analysis, we discuss insights into the GMing process and how this can be used to inform the design of a computational assistant for GMs.",

		"abstract": "Tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs) have more than 40 years of history and have achieved far-reaching influence, especially in countries where English is the primary language. However, even though many new games appear every year, TRPGs still does not occupy a dominant position in the game market. Most gamers prefer video games and board games to TRPG. The aim of this project is to use qualitative analysis to investigate which parts of TRPG design prohibit players from engaging with TRPGs and then to create a novel TRPG that addresses these design problems. This project will combine newly formulated design elements into a game designed to attract new players and ensure that player engagement is sustained in subsequent play. The project focuses on the example of China, where many people play video games and board games, but few know about or play TRPGs. Therefore, this research will mainly study the gaming behaviour and feedback of Chinese participants to study what methods can attract Chinese players to TRPGs.",

		"abstract": "Interventions for children and their families have traditionally stemmed from two interrelated frameworks: play-based child therapies, and family therapies (Gil, 2015). Integrated family play therapy frameworks aim to capitalize on the strengths of both approaches by combining meaningful engagement of children through play, and systems-level insights into patterns of family functioning and interaction (Gil, 2015). A virtually unexplored avenue for play-based therapeutic applications of role-play that may lend themselves to an integrated family play therapy framework are tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs); cooperative and narrative-based games wherein players adopt the role of fictional characters as they navigate a fantasy setting arbitrated by a game master. Case studies on the use of TRPGs with children and young adults have yielded initial evidence of their potential therapeutic utility (e.g., Blackmon, 1994; Enfield, 2007; Rosselet & Stauffer, 2013), however, research on their application is limited, particularly with families. The current study pilot tested an original TRPG module (“The Family Tabletop Adventure”) for use with families to establish the module’s potential therapeutic utility and identify targets for further refinement. A sample of three family groups (N = 11) were recruited to participate in six weekly online sessions (a 1-hour introductory session, four 1.5- to 2-hour game sessions, and a 1-hour exit interview). A variety of mixed-method measures were used to assess family functioning at baseline and post-game, including observational coding, self-report, and qualitative group interviews. Exploratory analyses of the findings indicated the module’s feasibility of implementation and ease of use, low iatrogenic risk, perceptions by families as fun and engaging, and potential utility across a range of family processes relevant to therapeutic contexts, including communication and problem solving, positive interactions and relationship building, and the generation of novel insights about family members. Family feedback was used to identify several targets for additional refinement of the game module to improve families’ comprehension and engagement with the game. The implications of these findings and their relevance to the use of TRPGs in family intervention contexts are discussed.",

		"abstract": "From Spacewar to the persistent multiplayer worlds of the 21st century, video games have moved from subculture to mainstream industry and various genres also have emerged. Among the genres, role-playing games (RPGs) require special attention, and readers of this chapter should be familiar with the concept of role-playing. RPGs are interactive worlds where players assume the roles of fictional characters and determine their own actions based on the character they play. Players typically follow a storyline in a fictional world and interact with other player (PCs) or non-player characters (NPCs) to complete missions and achieve various goals. As the player completes quests and overcomes conflicts, his/her character advances in levels and becomes stronger. Tabletop fantasy RPGs have parallels to wargames and educational simulations, but they focus more on the role and player choices are virtually unlimited (Fine, 1983). The key difference between tabletop RPGs (or FRPs) and computer RPGs is that the video game is no longer a collectively produced fantasy and takes place within strictly defined parameters (Apperley, 2006). These games were being played in many cities in Turkey, especially in İstanbul in the mid-1990s. To make a more detailed examination of the evolution and the current state of this subculture, an analysis of the late 1990s’ FRP Cafés would be undeniably noteworthy...",

What this changed environment means in terms of satisfying our social needs is not fully understood. To explore this question, I followed a group of Pathfinder Roleplaying Game players as they navigated adjusting their formerly in-person weekly game sessions to a virtual environment. While using a virtual tabletop platform for visual collaboration and a voice chat program to speak with one another allowed the players to hold sessions and didn’t appear to restrict their creative engagement with the game, the restrictions of the virtual environment inhibited social interaction and in one case worsened social anxiety for the players. This suggests that if we want to sustain online collaborative work in the future, we may need to reevaluate our virtual communication methods to better facilitate group-strengthening interactions.",

		"abstract": "There are certainly exiting possibilities in examining the tabletop role-playing game in general and D&D in particular within the context of literary studies. While games, gaming and gamers make for an interesting field of study in and of itself, recent developments in game studies seems to have favored the videogame and left the tabletop role-playing game behind. This thesis will attempt to approach the tabletop role-playing game in a novel way through the context of adaptation studies. While adaptations of written literature to film generally, and of fantasy literature to fantasy film specifically, have featured more frequently in academic study, there is little to be found in relation to the adaptation of a tabletop role-playing game to film. This thesis finds its starting point in the movie Dungeons & Dragons (2000) but will also, due to the relative scarcity of previous academic writing on similar or comparable subjects, explore adaptation across the domains of roleplaying games and cinema film at a more general level.",

		"abstract": "Traditional hierarchical research methodologies and resources are exclusive because family and external stakeholders are prioritized over neurodivergent people. Unfortunately, the continued lack of inclusive design principles result in a lack of understanding of both neurodivergent culture, and the needs of the neurodivergent community. This study actively includes neurodivergent people by using participatory research methodology, and inclusive design principles and pedagogy explored in Critical Disability Studies and Critical Autism Studies.\nThe continued pathologizing of neurodiverse conditions influences how medical systems treat neurodivergent people; Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) is the standard therapeutic treatment for autistic people. The focus of ABA and comparable treatments is to condition neurodivergent people to appear neurotypical, putting the onus on the neurodivergent community to change their behaviours instead of emphasizing acceptance and tolerance of neurodivergent people and behaviours. The statements and lived experiences of neurodivergent people who have experienced ABA showcases that it is not neurodivergent people that benefit from ABA and similar therapies, but neurotypical society that benefits from conditioning and changing the behaviours of neurodivergent folks (even if it may be at the expense of mental health and well-being).\nNeurodivergent self-advocacy groups, and Critical Autism scholars have expressed the need for therapies which build and encourage self-advocacy. Neurodiversity research focuses on conformity, so the unique abilities and culture of neurodivergent people is under researched. Role-play is an effective learning tool often used in therapy to help people practice skills in a low-risk environment. Role-play also is a core activity in Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TTRGPs) like Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) which allow players to explore and practice different identities and behaviours in a structured environment with more explicit rules than every day social interactions. D&D replicates the social constructs of the real world, but does not have neurodivergence or disability as an explicit social construct in its lore.\nI interviewed 5 self-identifying neurodivergent adults about their lived experience, held a co-design session, and observed 15 hours of their gameplay with custom designed neurodivergent mechanics with both strengths and weaknesses. We examined the gaps in structure and consent in the core D&D rules; the official rulebooks lack guidelines about boundary setting, consent, and facilitation for Dungeon Masters and players.\nCharacters’ neurodivergent mechanics allowed players to more explicitly model their experience in the groups’ co-created D&D world. This was possible because we used different TTRPG safety tools to establish boundaries which establish psychological safety that is not typically available to neurodivergent folks in everyday life. The experiences of players and their characters bled into one another. This caused players to experience positive shifts in self-esteem, and practice transferable self-autonomy skills for potential out-of-game, real life self-advocacy and liberation.",

This thesis demonstrates a Virtual Tabletop program, which is a game helper tool for preparing and playing tabletop role-playing games. It consists of a procedural generator of dungeon levels, a level editor, and a level play-through simulator. The procedural generation is using modified Space Partitioning Algorithm and Cellular Automaton for two types of dungeon levels, mansion-like and cavern-like respectively. This work also includes an analysis of the most common procedural map generation methods and their usage in game development, as procedural content generation is an increasingly popular way of cutting down costs and development time, while keeping the content original and interesting.",

The work employed tabletop roleplaying games and online roleplaying games as tools to examine the effects of anonymity on psychological introspection and interpersonal relations. Survey participants were asked to self-identify their own personality traits, the traits of a favorite character that they played online, the traits of one they played offline,  and the evolution of their real-life relationships with other players over time.",

		"abstract": "Players in Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) generate long-standing histories with their characters, but cannot express or see traces of their adventures in the game worlds. We are interested in designing game systems where players shape and contribute their own narratives as game content. Study one designed and playtested three Virtual Tabletop Role-Playing Game (VTTRPG) prototypes where we found that structured, graphical representations of players' traces support co-design and narrative analysis. We also identified four categories of traces: environment, build, memory and object. We introduce Play Traces, a novel analysis method for representing and co-designing with players and their narratives. A structured observation including Play Traces studied 17 players over 16 four-hour sessions in the third VTTRPG prototype. We found that players successfully (and enjoyably) co-designed novel narratives. We identified three themes for how traces can affect and support players in shaping new interactive narratives. We present four design implications describing how player-created narratives in MMORPGs should first Reveal & Pull Attention from other players, Invite & Push further exploration, Guide & Assist toward endings, and optionally Show & Hide traces. Finally, we discuss how treating players as co-designers offers a promising approach for developing the next generation of MMORPGs.",

		"abstract": "In this essay I examine the cover art of the 1979 version of The Dungeon Master's Guide, one of the original pieces of D&D artwork. Artwork in the D&D community has shaped and continues to shape how players understand aspects of the game, primarily because the game is one of pure imagination. This particular piece, for example, depicts an efreet, which is described as a giant djinn from the fire plane. Having a visual image allows players to better understand what the creators of D&D intend the monsters to actually be like. Examining the visual rhetoric of this image reveals the ideology held and perpetuated by the original writers of the game and presumably adopted by original players. The Dungeon Master's Guide is one of the core rule books of D&D, meaning that the book is required to play the game. The pervasiveness of this image in the D&D community and its position in D&D's history makes it an ideal visual text for rhetorical criticism. In the first section of this critique, I review literature about visual rhetoric and gendered images, and I introduce Sonja K. Foss's (1994) schema for evaluating visual imagery. In the second section, I describe the visual elements of the text. In the third section, using Foss's schema, I argue that the cover art of The Dungeon Master's Guide first functions to spark the imagination of its viewers and, second, functions to invite viewers to play D&D. These functions are only partially supported due to the exaggerated depiction of gender and race in the image, meaning that the image is centered on the hegemonic ideals of heterosexual, white males and is not invitational toward women or racial minorities. Finally, I conclude by articulating the implications of my argument.",

In particular, the use of oral storytelling and the use of folkloric artifacts within this podcast genre become key insights into how the queer community creates and performs its identity, connects its members into a cohesive community, and transmits its cultural information to both members and others. The ability of these podcasts to achieve this include how the storyteller/audience relationship is created — an extension of the oral folktale genre. In effect, the stories told by these podcasts are a key part of expressing queer identity and exploring the ways it is performed in several variations: the folk artifacts that communicate gender and sexuality, the performances of characters by their respective players, and the narrative structures created by the gaming systems themselves. To explore these elements, I examine Fast Times at D&D High, a podcast that features a diverse cast of players — both in terms of gender identity and sexualities, as well as race — and explores the early stages of identity creation through a group of high school teens navigating their world of magic and their queerness.",

		"abstract": "The issue of academic content in games is a tricky one. Filling a game with facts and figures is no guarantee the game will help students learn – and generally makes for a bad game to boot. On the other hand, players have an immense capacity to engage with the content of games, often learning about the material on their own time and with far more depth of engagement than they demonstrate in school. The role-playing game Ars Magica contains factual and literal historical material – yet rather than turn the game into academic work, as many explicitly educational games do, it turns history into part of the game. How does Ars Magica achieve this? How does it avoid the “problem of content?” And how do specific groups using the game negotiate that historical content and incorporate it into play? Through analysis of game observations and in-depth, semi-structured interviews, this paper examines the texts, practices and technologies of an Ars Magica group in which players have successfully developed and deployed historical literacies. Players voluntarily engage in historical thinking, reading and research, including both online and offline activities. Additionally, the group has developed an idiosyncratic but historically grounded approach to thirteenth century thinking and behavior, which they attempt to simulate in play.",

This paper explores the reported challenges and benefits of playing D&amp;D through teleconferencing hardware and software, and the experience of using virtual tabletops. A thematic analysis of a sample of Reddit threads discussing player experiences of transitioning D&amp;D to remote play during COVID-19 social distancing was undertaken. The findings highlight a variety of player attitudes and preferences towards playing D&amp;D remotely. The data suggest a mostly negative sentiment towards playing D&amp;D online for groups that had transitioned from in-person to remote play. Loss of in-person socialisation was identified as an important contributor to a poor play experience, but groups would persevere with remote play to maintain social relationships, suggesting that, for many players, D&amp;D serves an important social function beyond mere play. Some avenues for future research are identified.",

This was for the purpose of creating social connection between players and reducing anxiety and isolation during the pandemic.

		"abstract": "Deep generative models are currently the leading method for algorithmic music composition. However, one of the major problems of this method consists of controlling the trained models to generate compositions with given characteristics. This dissertation explores how to control deep generative models to compose music with a target emotion. Given the limitation of labeled data, this dissertation focuses on search-based methods that use a music emotion classifier to steer the distribution of a pre-trained musical language model. Three different search-based approaches have been proposed. The first one is a genetic algorithm to optimize a language model towards a given sentiment. The second one is a decoding algorithm, called Stochastic Bi-Objective Beam Search (SBBS), which controls the language model at generation time. The third method is also a decoding algorithm but based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. SBBS has been applied to generate background music for tabletop roleplaying games, matching the emotion of the story being told by the players. A dataset of symbolic piano music called VGMIDI has been created to support the work in this dissertation. VGMIDI currently has 200 pieces labeled according to the circumplex model of emotion, and an additional 3,640 unlabelled pieces. The three methods were evaluated with listening tests, in which human subjects indicated that the methods could convey different target emotions.",

		"abstract": "Games are, perhaps, a slightly new way of telling a story, expressing some meaning, or creating a beautiful environment. In that case, the philosophers should expect the relationship between game designer and player to map onto the familiar relationship between artist and audience. Designers hoped to create mechanics that would support collaborative storytelling, player creativity, and narrative improvisation. And the improvisations are still constrained by the rules – since players still have to follow the rules and roll for their various attempts inside the flashbacks. Those rolls create quite a bit of emergent chaos, which conditions further creativity. Players are playing to find out, to discover, how history goes – and they find those answers in their own collaborative improvisation, as guided by the directive to fit it into the bits of history that they have already previously improvised. Player-centric games typically create enormous room for player agency and creativity, and encourage rich improvisations as part of play.",

Cette communication présente les résultats de la 2ème étape d'un travail de recherche débuté en 2018 qui consiste en l'intégration de JdR en cours d'anglais dans des classes constituées et non volontaires. Pour ce faire, nous avons poursuivi nos évaluations en nous intéressant au niveau 1 et à trois items du niveau 2 du modèle de Kirkpatrick (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2016). De plus, nous nous sommes interrogés sur la pédagogie actionnelle présentée par le cadre européen commun de référence pour les langues (CECRL, 2001). Ce travail est le cœur de notre communication. Notre problématique est donc la suivante : en quoi le jeu de rôle sur table peut-il favoriser la mise en oeuvre de la pédagogie actionnelle ? Après sept séances réalisées avec deux groupes de Licence Économie et Gestion, les résultats du questionnaire et nos observations sont particulièrement positifs : les étudiant·e·s sont pleinement engagé·e·s dans cette activité et la parole est libérée. Nous avons pu par conséquent établir des liens pertinents entre cette pratique ludopédagogique innovante dans sa forme et la mise en oeuvre de la pédagogie actionnelle s'appuyant, comme le JdR sur table, sur des situations authentiques scénarisées.",

With Rancière’s politics as a framework, this study works backward from Ian Bogost’s Persuasive Games (2007) to his Unit Operations (2006), and then to Alain Badiou’s Manifesto for Philosophy (1989), in order to recover the radical politics undergirding Bogost’s distinct method of game criticism. Badiou’s Manifesto, going beyond Bogost’s primary philosophical source, Badiou’s Being and Event (1988), clariﬁes the political stakes of Badiou’s ontology, allowing us to return to the present with a more robust politics of procedurality motivating our critical work. From here, Alder and Rosenbaum’s Dream Askew / Dream Apart (2018) furnishes us with a provocative model of emancipatory procedurality suited not only for radical play but radical design, challenging the limits of Bogost’s “persuasion” as an activist paradigm.",

		"abstract": "When approached as a performance medium, tabletop role-playing games, or TTRPGs, demonstrate a dramaturgical method that allows for the exploration of an individual playerperformer’s agency, as well as the limits thereof. At the same time, the rule frameworks that structure play work to create experimental and pedagogical environments where suppositions about reality can become true within the virtual play-space, and thus allow space for speculative performances of said reality; if the rules say that something is true, what then becomes true by extension? The combination of these elements allows for the construction of ‘dramaturgies of being,’ which facilitate the performance of identity within the speculative framework, and thus the testing of said identities. Avery Alder’s 2018 game Dream Askew presents a dramaturgy of being for queer postapocalyptic identity exploration, community building, negotiation of agency, and teaching through simulated experience.",

With the Black Lives Matter movement, many racial questions have surged in popular discourse. This paper proposes to study the question of race in many editions of the fantasy roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons. By using the Player's Handbooks, we will show that its diegesis and rules includes a mostly essentialist definition of race where humans are at the center. Depending on the editions, we will show the descriptions of humans and half-humans (half-elves and half-orcs) point to the superiority of an imperialist human race that has more in common with an idealized colonial Europe than a representation of a diverse humanity.",

This research paper examines the process of transmedia adaptation through the case study of Shakespeare’s The Tempest adapted into a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) module. The Tempest is remediated as an interactive game based on Wizards of the Coast’s Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition ruleset, designed to be facilitated by a Dungeon Master and played by a group of three to five players. The process of remediating The Tempest takes the play’s setting, characters, narrative conflict, and dialogue and translates them into the formal structure of the TTRPG, prompting questions that have long been asked in adaptation studies: how important is fidelity to the source text? What is lost, gained, and changed in transmedia translation? What role does the translator play in the creation of the adaptation?",

This self-making and making-with is not understood in the sense of either self-possession or self-realization, but as a mode of what Stefano Harney and Fred Moten call \"fugitive planning,\" a planning with the potential for direct action at the cosmic scale. This cosmic poetics is a poetics that rejects \"the assignation of traits,\" as Legacy Russell beckons us to do, delighting in the glitched becomings of \"generic difference.\" Bringing this theoretical constellation to ground, this paper examines select examples from the recent boom in independent \"lyric\" games, situating them in their experimental aesthetic context in order to derive a praxis for the elaboration of the poetics here described.",

While therapeutic roleplay is empirically well established, the evidence surrounding D&D is unclear. The current study aims to summarize the literature pertaining this topic and present possible avenues for the implementation of D&D in psychological interventions. A Rapid Evidence Assessment (REA) was conducted following the standards by the Centre for Evidence-Based Management. Relevant search strings were entered in seven databases (e.g., PsycArticles, PsycInfo, Child Development & Adolescent Studies). Only papers published in English language till September 2020 were considered and their quality appraised. The thematic analysis of 13 studies yielded four themes: No unified personality type of D&D players, \nstakeholders’ attitude about D&D, lack of maladaptive coping associated with D&D, and potential psychological benefits of D&D. The results appear promising, but preliminary.  Practical implications are contextualized with the wider literature.",

Critical Role is an unscripted, live-streamed show where a fixed group of people play Dungeons and Dragons, an open-ended role-playing game. The dataset is collected from 159 Critical Role episodes transcribed to text dialogues, consisting of 398,682 turns. It also includes corresponding abstractive summaries collected from the Fandom wiki. The dataset is linguistically unique in that the narratives are generated entirely through player collaboration and spoken interaction. For each dialogue, there are a large number of turns, multiple abstractive summaries with varying levels of detail, and semantic ties to the previous dialogues. In addition, we provide a data augmentation method that produces 34,243 summary-dialogue chunk pairs to support current neural ML approaches, and we provide an abstractive summarization benchmark and evaluation.",

We hypothesize that a multi-task model that trains on character dialogue plus character relationship information improves transformer-based story continuation. To this end, we extend the Critical Role Dungeons and Dragons Dataset (Rameshkumar and Bailey, 2020) -- consisting of dialogue transcripts of people collaboratively telling a story while playing the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons -- with automatically extracted relationships between each pair of interacting characters as well as their personas. A series of ablations lend evidence to our hypothesis, showing that our multi-task model using character relationships improves story continuation accuracy over strong baselines.",

		"abstract": "Role-playing to experience marginalized lives impacts players and their communities for better and worse. Players may achieve greater empathy for marginalized people (Galinsky and Moskowitz 2000; Greitemeyer and Osswald 2010) or undergo meaningful psychological change via intentional and unconscious self-exploration (Bowman 2007). However, not all of these stories have a happily ever after. This article examines the ways in which such role-play as a marginalized character can also have unintended negative consequences. We relate this larp activity to the phenomenon of dark tourism, in which privileged individuals voluntarily enter disaster zones due to a mix of motives that include voyeurism and vicarious danger exposure, carrying with them a mixed bag of intentions and outcomes. This review aims to answer the following question: What are the positive and negative outcomes of role-playing as a marginalized character? We will explore individual and collective outcomes of this type of experiential learning and make recommendations for designers and players to better achieve desired positive outcomes and limit the negative ones. Our work draws on research from games studies, experimental psychology, pedagogical studies, and the emerging literature about the motivations and consequences of tourism that seeks to touch on pain, trauma, and even death (i.e., dark tourism).",

		"abstract": "Do role-playing games (RPGs) affect the player’s well-being? Several studies suggest that they might have an impact, but the topic of RPGs and well-being is usually only mentioned as a side note or curiosity. A clear, coherent picture on the topic of RPGs and well-being is missing. This review article aims to provide that picture by compiling the already existing knowledge in one place. I ask the questions: What can we learn from the already existing research? How should RPGs and well-being be studied? What questions need resolving? What can be gained from studying RPGs and well-being?\nRPG studies is a young academic interdisciplinary field of research, as is also the research of arts and well-being. They both are heterogeneous and related to a variety of academic traditions. They both are also dispersed, pragmatic, and until recently, scattered and lacking cohesive traditions or methodologies. Many basic ontological questions remain unsolved and the definitions of key concepts vary. They overlap in several discourses, such as the ones about (1) practices of sociodrama and replication therapy; (2) social, cultural, and digital capital; (3) leisure time research; (4) performance studies; (5) the topic of erotic role-play; (6) problematic vs. therapeutic gaming; and (7) health education. Previous research and practices focus mainly on live action role play (larp) and well-being, suggesting a positive impact. Online RPGs share their own traditions, but studies on tabletop RPGs and well-being are difficult to find. The studies are often case-studies or examine abstract topics such as human experiences.\nIn these studies, it becomes evident that RPGs do indeed impact well-being. However, questions such as how, why, and what features in RPGs affect well-being remain unanswered. In addition, the research has mainly been executed from the perspective of either RPGs or arts and well-being. Interdisciplinary cooperation is the key to successfully diving into the world of RPGs and well-being. Doing so would offer both fields useful practices, interesting perspectives, new opportunities for publication and academic discussion. It would not only add knowledge about RPGs and well-being but offer perspective to the unresolved ontological questions of each field. Eventually, further study on RPGs and well-being could transfer into the usage of RPGs in the fields of well-being, health, and therapy in a similar manner that arts are currently being used.",

Building on previous research that documented players engaging in role-playing games, livestreaming, and role-playing game (RPG) fandom subculture, this study specifically explored the perspectives of individuals who reported a transformational impact of experiencing gaming vicariously through watching Critical Role. This paper reports a detailed narrative of one of the cases from qualitative interviews, which conveys major themes that illustrate the perspective of the individual watching. The paper compliments this detailed case description with a discussion of findings from seven in depth interviews to explore the experiences of the interviewee focused on in the context of the study sample. This study is primarily focused on the individual watchers’ experience of gameplay and role-playing experiences, which they attribute to personal growth. The term parasocial gaming is introduced to characterize a part of vicarious experience associated with watching media figures playing games.",

For broader implementation, the design of the game has to serve curricular and pedagogical needs alike. This paper presents core principles of design and implementation of educational live action role-playing games in curricular primary and secondary education. Over the course of 5 years, 16 live action role-playing games with a total of 53 cycles of Design-based Research (DBR) including design, testing, and evaluation were conducted in German schools. This paper synthesizes 17 essential principles from the DBR cycles as best practice in the context of subject-bound curricular focus. The results of our study show that four parameters differ in schools from extracurricular live action role-playing activities: curricular guidelines, compulsory participation, grading practices, and time/space confinements. These four parameters need to be taken into consideration at all times when designing and conducting a live action role-playing game in a school environment. Moreover, design for simplicity and inclusion is paramount for successful implementation within subject-teaching in schools as a rewarding tool to foster content-knowledge and to promote social and personal skills.",

		"abstract": "Accounts of trans people using role-playing games (RPGs) as a safer space to “try out” another way to be gendered can be found in numerous sites – from the memetic, to the anecdotal, to the academic. Using autoethnography and post-structuralist queer theory of performativity in combination with scholarly perspectives of RPGs as sites for potentially transformative experiences, I consider the ways in which live-action role-playing games (larps) might help trans people express, explore, and embody their subjectivity. I argue that despite there being a relatively small (though growing) number of larps designed to encourage players to consider gender and sexuality norms in society, there remains no larp that intentionally allows trans people (or those questioning their gender) to consider their gender subjectivity therein.\nScholarly\nperspectives on larps suggest that they might provide a site for the simulation of complex socio-cultural dynamics, a space to adopt different social roles, and the alibi and scaffolding to do so in a way that is validating with a community of like-minded role-players (Deterding 2018; Bowman and Hugaas 2021). I present examples of larps that, either by design or not, seem to have provided opportunities for gender role-play and transformative experiences for some trans players. I consider the possible limitations the embodied experience of larps -- as opposed to digital and table-top RPGs (TRPGs) -- might have in allowing such exploration for some trans players, particularly in potentially transphobic play environments. I argue however, that the embodied nature of larps might also provide an opportunity to explore gender role-play in such a way that allows for the validation of more diverse physical and social gender presentations, as well as the rehearsal thereof in a safer space. I present accounts of trans people -- including my own autoethnography -- using role-playing games, larps, and other activities/environments not necessarily consciously designed for the purpose of gender exploration as the basis for how this might be designed for intentionally in larps. I conclude by proposing to design a larp that could provide an opportunity to express, explore, and embody non-normative gender, and I pose a series of questions that I believe such a design should seek to answer.",

Violence within the system’s 5th edition core rulebook, the Player’s Handbook (Wizards of the Coast 2014b), is analysed using textual analysis with insight from previous research on common violence motivators of heroism, hatred, and sensation-seeking curiosity. Overall, the study concludes that the D&D system facilitates playing violence, specifically through heroic motivation based on androcentric perceptions of chivalric fantasy ideals. This study also finds that the system spotlights combat over nonviolent interactions. Future research could investigate how participant agency may affect violence in similar traditional RPG systems, and why choosing violence in a no-consequence game could reflect real-world behaviours.",

		"abstract": "This paper presents two studies on promoting social communication and leisure satisfaction of children and youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) through the use of tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs). The first study involved four junior high school students with ASD, and focused on \"intentional speech directed to other children\" and their \"consensu-making\" during TRPG play sessions. The results of the analysis suggest that intentional speech as well as the ability to reach consensus increased remarkably between the 14th and the 1st session. The second study investigated the efficacy of leisure activity using TRPGs to enhance the quality of life (QOL) of children and youth with ASD. Fifty-five teenagers with high-functioning ASD participated in the study and responded to the standardized \"Questionnaire for Measuring Quality of Life\" before and after the TRPG activities. After a total of five sessions once a month significant improvement in the total scores and most of subscales of QOL could be observed. The subscales of \"emotional well-being\" and \"friends\" in particular, improved remarkably. These findings suggest that leisure activities.",

We discuss how PC death affects gameplay by breaking up time, by ending or starting a period of play, or by reinforcing or severing player and PC connections.

		"abstract": "A social safety team, called “social harassment support team,” found implementation at the “Drachenfest,” one of the largest European larp events with around 5,000 participants. Such a team seemed necessary due to an increasing societal awareness of problematic social behavior and thus, an amplified demand for a solution to deal with such issues at larps. The “Drachenfest” as a unique and challenging environment called for the implementation of something not yet described in earlier research about social safety.\nThis paper will detail the implementation of a social safety team as a best practice example. It will consider questions of how to put such a team together and how to write an accompanying code of conduct. The paper also describes standard procedures for the work of such a team. The team performed admirably but still offered valuable lessons for improvement. The paper seeks to illustrate these lessons to strengthen attempts at implementing social safety teams at other events.",

		"abstract": "The idea of player safety – a concern for the psychological well-being of the people who play role-playing games on the part of those who design and run those games – has within the past several years emerged as a rubric for a whole host of pre-game, in-game, and post-game procedures intended to address that concern, particularly in larp but in tabletop RPGs as well. However, considerations of player safety sometimes produce skeptical responses on the part of those who fear, for instance, that player safety mechanisms will somehow dilute the experience or stifle their creativity. Examining the dynamics of conversations produced by these countervailing concerns can provide insight into the nature of RPG participation. A full understanding of these dynamics, however, will benefit from an investigation of the historical underpinnings of the discourse of player safety. To that end, this essay explores conversations around safety-related discourse within the online sphere known as the “Forge Diaspora.”\nThe Forge was an online discussion site for tabletop RPG design, publication, and play that was active in the first decade of the twenty-first century, serving to champion creator-owned “indie RPGs” and game design innovation during that period. In addition, it inspired a panoply of blogs and forums where further discussion took place. Among the considerations related to player safety discussed within the Forge Diaspora were the tools Ron Edwards called Lines and Veils and Meguey Baker’s complementary principles of Nobody Gets Hurt and I Will Not Abandon You. This essay uses techniques of rhetorical analysis to reconstruct frameworks of narrative and argumentation about these and related ideas with the goal of providing historical context for contemporaneous conversations about player safety.",

		"abstract": "Online larps have recently grown in popularity and see players acting over video and text communication platforms to play their characters in real time. These games often use the medium as a diegetic space and are written with the assumption that both the players and the characters are interacting remotely; the characters communicate through video calls, radio signals or text messages to match the distributed nature of the players. However, a number of online larps do not employ this strategy and instead have the players operating remotely while the characters are in the same location. This article explores the challenges and possibilities of creating online, immersive games where there is dissonance between medium and activity and how games can retain immersion and embodiment. By using physical and digital artefacts, augmenting the environment and generating creative ways to interact with those spaces; designers are able to create meaningful, engaging games.",

		"abstract": "The author’s research team has been conducting “Libardry” a game-type library guidance program to learn how to use university libraries. However, in the fiscal year 2020, university libraries had to be closed due to the influence of preventing the spread of the new coronavirus. Under these circumstances, many university libraries attempted to provide library guidance online. In the same way, the author’s research team tried to create a library guidance “Libardry Form” which does not rely on any paid tools or special skills. Based on the research team’s prior experiences with game-type library guidance, we conducted an exploratory study to understand the game’s impact on library learning. Concretely, for a trial survey of the features of the “Libardry Form” we recruited eleven university students during classes taught by the first author and thirty-one participants from the general public via SNS. After playing the game, we asked the participants to fill out a questionnaire. Thirty-three respondents (78.6%) preferred our game-type library guidance to the more common video-type guidance. We also asked the eleven university students who experienced the game to cooperate with us for additional pre- and post-surveys and analyzed the results of the eight valid responses we received. We found that it was difficult to recognize the influence of the “Libardry Form” on sophomore and junior students who had used university libraries before. Contrastingly, although it is not possible to generalize the results due to the small number of valid responses, the results indicate that the “Libardry Form” may improve the understanding of freshmen who have little experience using university libraries.",

The players who participated in this scenario afterward answered an open-ended survey. On the one hand, the survey results point to limitations of the current version of the scenario but also implied essential factors for developing and managing CoC TRPG scenarios and sessions for peace educational purposes. First, for effective sessions, the scenario needs to incorporate the main theme intelligibly for players. Second, letting players think about how their characters perceive social issues may help players rethink their views and contribute to raising awareness of an issue. Third, sessions benefit from adapting them to different formats of play: offline and remote play, voice chat, and text chat sessions.",

Rather than simply functioning as digital equivalents of paper character records, keepers serve as shared sheets, allowing all players to refer to the information on all player characters simultaneously; take advantage of the programming interface of Google Sheets to provide automated functions like drop-down selections for character options or real time calculation of stats; often include tabs for tracking shared session and campaign notes as well as scenario and game state information for the GM; include a lot of the reference information needed to play the game; integrate supplementary safety tools that facilitate play; and provide links to other accessories used during online play like digital dice rollers or additional visualization tools.\n&nbsp;\nIn discussing character keepers, we outline their characteristics and the pragmatics of their use, followed by elements of a short history of this format, a description of some historical and contemporary examples, a systematic exploration of contemporary player and designer theorizing on this topic, and an attempt at locating our examination of character keepers within the broader context of (role-playing) game studies: participation and co-creation, platform studies, and an aesthetics of indie TRPGs.",

		"abstract": "Loisir de niche, le jeu de rôle grandeur nature ou « larp » a été relativement peu étudié par la recherche en sciences de l'éducation. Ce jeu de société a pour spécificité intéressante d’impliquer le corps dans une activité intercréative et théâtrale (Caïra, 2007 ; Kapp, 2013 ; David, 2015, 2016 ; Harviainen et al., 2018). L'étude des processus de participation individuelle et sociale qui ont lieu avant, pendant et après un larp peut nous aider à en comprendre les processus d'apprentissage dans une situation d’apprentissage informelle (Schugurensky, 2007 ; Brougère, 2009, 2016). Nous basons notre analyse sur une participation-observante auto-ethnographique, complétée par des entretiens avec des joueur·euses et des concepteur·trices du larp Legion (Rolling, 2016). Celui-ci est organisé comme une marche hivernale en République Tchèque pour vivre un récit historique tchèque et constitue par sa corporalité un exemple facilement différentiable du jeu de société ou du jeu de rôle dit « sur table ». Notre analyse nous amène à comprendre comment le dispositif encourage l’apprentissage auto-dirigé pour « mieux » participer aux mécanismes ludiques et théâtraux proposés, et favorise la constitution de communautés éphémères de pratiques (Lave, Wenger, 1991 ; Wenger, 2005 ; Berry, 2008) dont les échanges et le débriefing contribuent à des apprentissages sociaux, émotionnels et cognitifs. La méthodologie utilisée ouvre la voie à des associations possibles entre pratiques de recherche et pratiques de jeu de rôle en larp.",

		"abstract": "Recent years have seen debate about whether depictions of inherently evil monster races such as orcs in role playing games or literature/movies such as Lord of the Rings could be considered racist. Although such decisions may be subjective, little data has been produced to inform the debate regarding how critical an issue this is. In particular, does consuming such material relate to racism in the real world, or do a majority of individuals, particularly people of color, consider such depictions racist? The current study sought to address these issues in a sample of 308 adults (38.2% non-White) a subset of whom (17%) were players of the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons. Playing Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) was not associated with greater ethnocentrism (one facet of racism) attitudes. Only 10.2% found a depiction of orc monsters as inherently evil to be offensive. However, when later asked the blunter question of whether the same depiction was racist, the number jumped to 34.0%, with women particularly inclined to endorse this position. This suggests asking people about racism may prime them to see racism in material they hadn’t previously found to be offensive. Neither participant race nor history playing the D&D game was associated with perceptions of offensiveness or racism.",

		"abstract": "Interactive narrative systems are often embedded in games: works of playable media that enable players to participate in or experience a story through game mechanics. But play practices directed toward the expressive creation of story seem to challenge a games-centric understanding of narrative play. Consequently, we propose that some interactive narrative systems can be better understood as a diﬀerent form of playable media: narrative instruments, analogous to musical instruments in their provision of support for authorship-oriented forms of play.",

		"abstract": "Introduction:\nOne of the nursing activities in Primary Health Care is the nurse home visit, with the objective of establishing a follow-up of the various individuals and families whose health is at risk or affected. In addition, they should monitor the physical environment at home for elements beneficial or detrimental to health. Difficulties are observed in nursing students to be able to mentally stage the different theoretical clinical cases, being the nurse home visit one of these situations that covers this problem.\nThe main objective is to improve nursing students' knowledge, skills and attitudes about nurse home visit using clinical cases with tabletop role-playing game mechanics. \n\nThe specific objectives are the following: \n(1) to assess the usefulness and playable experience through the aforementioned mechanics in this context, \n(2) to evaluate the students' performance based on the role played in the clinical case through the virtual tabletop role-playing game.\n\nMethods:\nThe teaching methodologies used were gamification and case-based learning. In the days prior to the simulation of three virtual clinical cases, 3-4 nursing students were assigned as family members and patients for each one, sending them their corresponding house plan (produced using the Sweet Home 3D software) and a genogram of the family.\nFor virtual simulation, Google Meet was used with Google Meet Dice Roller extension, allowing random events or factors to be added to the clinical cases by means of a virtual ten-sided dice (1: worst event, 10: best event). In each clinical case, a student volunteered to act as a nurse in the case, at which time the patient's clinical history was provided. Once prepared, the story of each clinical case was developed from the street of the patient's home until the end of the nurse home visit, with a maximum duration of 30 minutes. Teachers acted as game masters.\nA pre-test questionnaire of nursing home visit was distributed. At the end of the simulation, participants completed the GAMEX scale, while the assistants evaluated the organisational, communicative and improvisational skills of the student who acted as nurse. All students completed a post-test knowledge questionnaire together with items related to their role.\n\nResults:\nPrior to the simulation, 66.7% (32) of the nursing students were familiar with role-playing games and 37.5% (18) had previously played tabletop role-playing games. Participants highlighted that the tabletop role-playing game mechanics were very useful for the development of the virtual clinical cases (9.23 +- 1.14 points), highlighting high scores on positive emotions and low scores on negative emotions about their gaming experience. Attendees felt that the students who acted as nurses did not plan the nurse home visit well and sometimes did not pay attention to the physical aspects of the home. However, after the simulation, knowledge of the most important phase of the nurse home visit (planning) was significantly improved (Z=-3; p=0.003).\n\nConclusions:\nThe use of tabletop role-playing game mechanics in the simulation of virtual clinical cases has been positive for the improvement of some knowledge and skills about nurse home visit in nursing students. The gaming experience was rewarding for the participants, while the attendees were able to detect and observe the difficulties of nursing in the home environment.",

		"abstract": "Playing satisfies basic human needs such as deepening social relationships (Melton et al., 2019) and experiencing\nan ideal self’s characteristics (Przybylski et al., 2012). In addition, games foster student engagement through the\nuse of intrinsic motivation, critical thinking skills, and the use of creative problem solving (Boghian et al., 2019;\nQuaye & Haper, 2015; Marinho et al., 2019; Thangmak, 2019). Thus, it is no surprise that there has been a recent\nincrease in the exploration of gamification as a pedagogical tool (Furdu et al., 2017; Hanus & Fox, 2015; Koivisto\n& Hamari, 2014; Sanchez et al., 2019). This article explores role-playing games as pedagogical tools for educating\nstudent trainings, such as an R.A. conflict management workshop, a hazing prevention seminar, a teaching assistant\norientation, a bystander intervention program to combat sexual assault, etc. Furthermore, it will reimagine the\ntraditional approach to role-play activities in educational settings and suggest slight modifications to create more\nrealistic and educative experiences.",

		"abstract": "This article includes an in-depth discussion of the “magical” potential of role-playing. We describe some of the barriers to transformation that can arise from alibi, cognitive dissonance, role-distancing, and the pressures of conformity. We will then examine role-playing from two quite different lenses:\n\na) Conceptualizations of ritual, aspecting, and manifestation in occult and metaphysical traditions; and\n\nb Research in the social sciences about the power of thought and narrative upon self-concept, behavior, performance, and well-being.\n\nThis preliminary exploration of concepts that might help explain the potential of role-playing as a form of postmodern “magic” is by no means exhaustive or detailed. Rather, we present vignettes of thought from various areas of spiritual practice and social science. We explore how role-playing, perspective taking, narrative, ritual, and the conscious use of specific imaginative practices can directly impact people’s performance at tasks, their self-concepts, and their perceived agency. Then, we examine different models of bleed theory, investigating ways that we can raise awareness around bleed effects and consciously steer toward or away from them as needed.\n\nIf we intentionally emphasize responsibility, safety, and growth in our communities, we can imagine the role-playing space as a transformational container within which we can explore our edges and mold our self-concepts through play. We can use alibi as a tool to permit greater experimentation, while decreasing its strength when we wish to transfer skills, insights, and personality traits outside of the magic circle. Finally, through conscious and deliberate integration practices, we can distill these insights and more permanently infuse our lives with this magic, manifesting new conceptions of self, of community, of relationships, and of our life potential.",

		"abstract": "Tutkimus esittää teoreettisen viitekehyksen leikkimielisyyden, leikin ja pelien ymmärtämiseen. Viitekehys on laadittu konstruktionistisen ludologian tarpeisiin, ja se pohjautuu realistiseen sosiaaliseen konstruktionismiin. Työ itsessään sijoittuu pelitutkimuksen kentälle. Tutkimuksen merkittävin anti on kolmitahoinen: ensinnäkin teoreettinen viitekehys leikkimielisyyden, leikin ja pelin ymmärtämiselle ja erottelulle on keskeisin tulos. Toiseksi työ esittää useita malleja sosiaalisen leikin ymmärtämiselle. Kolmanneksi nämä teoreettiset työkalut testataan käytännössä kolmen suppeamman tutkimuksen avualla.  \n \nTutkimuksessa käytetty käsitys leikistä on hyvin lavea: teoreettisen viitekehyksen puitteissa käsitellään niin eläinten, lasten, kuin aikuistenkin leikkiä. Mukana on kaikki toiminta, jota toteutetaan tekemisen itsensä vuoksi, mutta myös kaikki kulttuurisesti leikiksi kutsuttu. Viitekehys ei myöskään erottele ’hyvän’ ja ’pahan’, sovinnaisen ja sopimattoman, leikin välillä. Pelit, niin digitaaliset kuin perinteisetkin, samoin kuin pelit toimintana ja tavaroina, asettuvat viitekehyksessä laajempaan leikin jatkumoon. Viitekehyksessä on tilaa jopa tavoitteellisessa mielentilassa käydylle leikille. Viitekehys linjaa rajoja leikin ja ei-leinkin väliin irrottamatta niitä arjesta tai suhtautumatta leikkiin poikkeuksellisena. Keskiössä on leikkijä, ei suunnittelija tai muotoilija. \n \nViitekehyksessä leikillisyys mielentilana ja leikki aktiviteettina on analyyttisesti erotettu toisistaan. Molemmat rakentuvat biologiselle pohjalle niin ihmisissä kuin muissakin eläimissä, mutta ihmisten kohdalla tietoisuus leikistä ja sosiaalinen konstruointi johtavat monimutkaisiin leikin ja pelin käsitteellistämisiin. Työssä esitelty viitekehys nivoo yhteen aikaisempaa tutkimusta lukuisilta eri kentiltä. Siltojen rakentaminen eri tieteenalojen välillä ja nykyisen pelien tutkimuksen nivominen viimeisen reilun sadan vuoden aikana tehtyyn tutkimukseen ovat työn keskeistä antia. Työssä esitelty konstruktionistisen ludologian viitekehys tarjoaa teoreettisen pohjan leikillisyyden, leikin ja pelien rajaamiseen irrottamatta niitä ympäröivästä maailmasta. \n \nTutkimuksessa esitellään myös useita sosiaalista leikkiä kuvaavia malleja. Kaikki pelaaminen, myös yksinpelit, on jossain määrin sosiaalista, ja yksi malleista setvii ja selventää pelaamista osallistujien lukumäärän perusteella. Toinen malli auttaa ymmärtämään sosiaalista leikkiä mielentilan ja sosiaalisen kontekstin ristivalossa. Tämä työkalu osoittaa leikillisyyden ja leikin erottamisen hedelmällisyyden. \n \nTeoreettinen viitekehys ja siihen liittyvät sosiaalisen leikin mallit laitetaan töihin kolmessa suppeammassa tarkastelussa. Ensiksi tutkaillaan kiusapelaamista ja trollaamista leikkinä. Toiseksi tutkitaan peliyden ja leikkisyyden sekoittamista pelillistämisen haasteiden lähteenä. Kolmanneksi tutkitaan eksplisiittisten sääntöjen ja yhtenäisen pelikulttuurin puutteen asettamia haasteita pervasiivisessa pelissä Conspiracy For Good.",

		"abstract": "Tabletop role-playing games have existed for decades and, despite the advent of technology and some bad press in the 1980's, has seen a resurgence in recent years thanks to popular culture. Though there has been some interest in sociological and ethnographic research in the broader realm of role-playing games as a whole, minimal research exists specifically examining the therapeutic applications of tabletop role-playing games (e.g., Dungeons & Dragons). The purpose of this capstone is to examine the limited existing research on therapeutic applications of tabletop role-playing games, to ground the use of this intervention in other, well-established modalities, and to make links with related areas of research such as in education and learning and the field of simulation training. Further, this paper seeks to understand reasons why therapeutically applied tabletop role-playing games remain widely under-researched in academia, and to identify possible barriers to access. The final purpose of this paper is to discuss ways to lower and eliminate barriers to access, as well as to suggest a possible outreach program to educate adult gatekeepers for youth engagement in therapeutically applied tabletop role-playing game programs, as improving social skills in youth has been demonstrated to be a positive outcome of this intervention.",

		"abstract": "For over two decades, a moral panic over fantasy role-playinggames has swept America, fuelled by a minority of fundamentalistChristians who have campaigned against games such as Dungeons& Dragons on the grounds that they led youth to Satanism, suicide,and violent crime. In his 2015 book, Dangerous Games: What theMoral Panic over Role-Playing Games says about Play, Religion,and Imagined Worlds, David Laycock explores why fantasy roleplayinggames seem similar enough to religion to provoke fear,as well as the dynamics of this moral panic. While he, apparently,did not set out to write a book about Islam, his insights about religion,fantasy, and narrative opened my eyes to the dynamics oftwentieth-century Islam. Additionally, as a Muslim reader livingduring a “moral panic” over Islam, Laycock’s analysis helped meunderstand that today’s Islamophobia in America has little to dowith Islam. Lastly, although Muslim gamers, fantasy/sciencefictionauthors, and game developers are usually underacknowledged,there is increasing interest in Muslims and fantasy/science-fiction. I hope to call attention to this invisible cohort.",

		"abstract": "In this thesis project, the tabletop roleplaying game, Dungeons and Dragons, is analyzed as a metaphor for alternate forms of male role models for early adolescent boys in the Duffer brothers’s television series, Stranger Things, and the novel, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, by Junot Diaz. The purpose of this analysis is to criticize how there is a lack of modern-day adult male figures to look up to in the US. In this alternate male role model, which the game presents, the characters can develop a masculine gender performance, in contexts that have absent parental figures. In analyzing these texts, I utilize a focus on gender studies, with a combination of class theory from the works of Marx and Foucault and Borderlands theory from the work of Anzaldua. Each text provides characters who must face obstacles, related to these theoretical approaches, and the project focuses on how they must face these without a male role model to guide them. The tabletop role playing game provides a fantasy space that allows for the  adolescent boys in these two texts, to experience heroic action, and have a model to become men.",

		"abstract": "This essay explores the application in live participatory performance of “participant engagement,” an ethnographic method of participant observation originally developed to study online roleplaying communities, but which has also been applied to the study of theatrical, coperformative events in which the audience has meaningful agency. The challenge here is how to frame “audience ethnography” in contexts where the relationship between audience and performer is blurred. This can involve a range of dynamics, whether the performer and audience are one and the same, such as in online or live action roleplaying, or in cases where audience agency has an active role in composing the work. Many of these forms do not allow for passive participation, requiring researchers to actively engage in the coperformance. Through the lenses of performance and feminist ethnography, participant engagement frames the embodied researcher as performer and the act of participant observation as a performance to address three paradoxes inherent in studying immersive fictional worlds: (1) the need to adopt a fictional persona compatible with the world being studied; (2) the need to fully engage with the play activities proscribed by the fictional context; (3) the need to reconcile the inherent contradiction within factual ethnographic accounts of a fictional worlds.",

		"abstract": "There are numerous examples of role-playing being adapted and included as a pedagogical technique in teaching, including in higher education. For example, teachers might simulate different scenarios, and role-play different stakeholders and users, in order to create more experiential types of learning environments. Role-playing can also provide an opportunity for students to actively explore, reflect upon and personalise the material that is studied. Similar techniques can be seen in User Experience Design (UXD), where practitioners create personas and scenarios to describe representative and typical users and use-cases. In this report, we propose an alternative use to the more traditional way of using personas and scenarios in academia as well as in industry: as character sheets and role-playing. Instead of being more analytical and descriptive tools in the design process, our role-playing approach invites exploration and personal interaction. Putting such character sheets into action allows the design team to interact with hypothetical, but typical users, thus providing a richer understanding of their context, and facilitating an empathetic understanding of the different stakeholders and their sometimes conflicting interests. This is particularly relevant in an educational context, where students are learning and training to improve as designers.",

		"abstract": "BackgroundThis chapter explores player interactions and engagement in tabletop role-playing game settings.ObjectiveParticularly focusing on the intersection of gaming systems, virtual settings, and player interactions, this chapter seeks to explore how implicit systems shape individuals? experiences and behaviors. Through this focus, the chapter intentionally draws parallels between informal gaming settings and classroom-based interactions.SettingThough this study makes specific connections to classroom pedagogies, data were collected from a multiyear ethnographic study of playing tabletop role-playing games with adult participants in informal learning environments. Data were collected from within public gaming cafes and shops.Research DesignParticipant observation within a role-playing game community served as the primary approach to this ethnographic study. In addition to fieldnote-based observation, interviews with players and archival analysis of gaming artifacts helped triangulate meaning-making at the gaming table. Analysis was conducted through an inductive coding approach that focused on player interactions, systems, and settings.FindingsCultural values, including racism and sexism, shaped player experiences at the table, based on systemic designs and textual guidance from game-related fiction. While games speak to broad possibilities for exploring race and gender, these constructs become limited through the layers of player beliefs, designed rule sets, and depictions within narratives. The emancipatory possibilities of ludic imagination are flattened by cultural norms that may oppress.ConclusionsBroadening the findings from this study, this chapter concludes with classroom-based recommendations. If a contemporary approach to critical pedagogy depends on dialogue and cultural understanding, this chapter points to the limitations of confining such work to traditional classroom settings. Instead, it suggests that an interrogation of these systems, alongside youth, is a necessary step in critically oriented classrooms.",

The study draws on a thematic analysis of qualitative data (N = 201) collected in April 2020, which is explored through the lens of Apperley’s (2010) theory of gaming rhythms. The results illuminate the ways in which gaming was situated in everyday life both during and before the COVID-19 restrictions, and how the pandemic and its associated restrictions disrupted, reinforced, and reconﬁgured the everyday rhythms of gaming. The situation impacted individuals and families differently, being beneﬁcial to some and detrimental to others, contingent on other aspects of respondents’ lives. The results underline how an individual’s gaming does not happen in isolation, but takes place in the conﬁnes of everyday life, shaped by factors outside the individual’s control. Developing Apperley’s theory, the results show that gaming can be a very resilient activity, given the right circumstances.",

		"abstract": "BackgroundRole-playing game (RPG) is a term that covers a series of forms and styles of games that involve, in some way, the creation, representation and progression of characters who interact in a fictional world under a system of structured rules. Its applications and effects on human behavior and mental health are, however, still an underexplored area.MethodsA scoping review was performed on the literature about RPGs as a therapeutic tool or prevention strategy in psychotherapies and mental health, highlighting studies? populations, forms of RPG and interventions used. To that, a systematic search in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, BVS/LILACS databases and grey literature was performed.ResultsOf the 4,069 studies reviewed, 50 sources of evidence were included. The majority was published as of 2011 (78%) in journals (62%) and targeted therapeutic uses of RPGs (84%). Most interventions used computer (50%) or tabletop RPGs (44%), mostly with cognitive and/or behavioral (52%) therapeutical approaches and targeting adolescents (70%).ConclusionThe findings suggest a potential use of RPGs as a complementary tool in psychotherapies. However, only 16% of the studies included were experimental. We identified considerable heterogeneity in RPGs definitions, outcomes and interventions used, preventing a systematic review. Thus, more empirical and well-designed studies on the application of RPGs in mental health are needed.",

		"abstract": "This paper discusses the communication in tabletop role-playing games that we call metadiscourse. Prior study of gaming and the act of play prove that the space is inherentlysocial. However, we speculate that, through metadiscourse, the social aspect of the tabletop role-playing game is central to group cohesion and perpetuation of the gaming subculture. Metadiscourse involves conversation not linked to the current game but could be cordial and relational, critical, or completely unrelated to the game. However, it is an informal conversation that would not occur if there was no game. In metadiscourse there are determinations of gaming capital, or elements of value. Participation in metadiscourse allows an individual to feel included in the game and gaming subculture. However, metadiscourse demonstrates a level of gaming capital through situatedness and affordances that can act as a gatekeeping function for individuals.",

		"abstract": "This chapter deals with US game designer Mike Pondsmith, who is widely known as the world-builder and a co-designer of CD Projekt Red’s (CDPR’s) Cyberpunk 2077 (2020), an action role-playing video game set in the near future based on over three decades of published game content from Pondsmith’s company R. Talsorian Games (RTG). His instrumental role in creating Cyberpunk (1988), among other tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs) cannot be overstated. Cyberpunk helped establish the aesthetic and mechanical basis for all future cyberpunk game franchises, including Shadowrun (1989–), Deus Ex (2000–), SLA Industries (1993), and Invisible, Inc. (2015). Cyberpunk 2020 (1990), the best-known edition of his TRPG, is set in Night City, an American dystopian metropolis that features cyber-equipped, street-savvy mercenaries (“edgerunners”) who stylishly break into secure facilities to extract valuable goods. These edgerunners are “survivors in a tough, grim world, faced with life and death choices […The] quintessential Cyberpunk character is a rebel with a cause” (Pondsmith et al. 3). Pondsmith envisioned the TRPG prose and game mechanics required for players to successfully run their own cyberpunk stories and established the boundaries, norms, values, and verbs of most successor cyberpunk game titles.",

		"abstract": "North American larping (live-action roleplaying) is a collaborative performance that encourages critical and creative engagement with cooperative, improvisational narratives. Nevertheless, larping often relies on problematic engagements with race and racial stereotypes. Like many gaming hobbies, larp uses the idea of a “playable race”. Unlike other gaming arenas, however, larping necessitates that players physically embody a character in order to participate in the collaborative narrative: larpers embody fictional races and engage in a complex form of “race play”. Within this context, non-Indigenous players frequently appropriate Indigenous cultural practices and mobilize racist stereotypes. This paper explores this phenomenon and its ramifications. Based on seven years of ethnographic fieldwork and community participation in New England larping communities, I examine how concepts of Indigenous identity manifest in New England larp. I explore both Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspectives in order to demonstrate (a) how fantastical play facilitates cultural appropriation and damaging “race play” and (b) how these spaces affect Indigenous players. I close with Indigenous perspectives on new possibilities for Indigenous larp projects and cultural reclamation.",

I examine threads from a Facebook group discussing the topic, and code the reactions of men participating. I discuss how some gamer masculinities that are displayed reinforces a belief of epistemic privilege among White men that allows for hegemonic responses to discussions that involve structural racism. I propose larp gamer masculinity as a hybrid masculinity, complicit in its support of hegemonic models but appropriating elements of subordinated populations to allow individuals to feel like an “outsider.” In these gaming discourse spaces, men employ an anti-intellectualized form of digital hooliganism as a rationale for their claims. These men dismiss claims of discrimination as they see those as characteristics outside the scope of the game. The resistance exhibited by these men reacting to changes should be viewed differently than extremist discourses.",

Fiasco is a TRPG that utilizes prompts inspired by genre fiction to collaboratively generate, establish, and resolve scenes between a varied cast of characters in several rounds improvisational roleplay. To explore the range of literacy experience opportunities, present in its play, we present our experiences designing and playing a Fiasco session and reflect upon the transformative potential of tabletop games in creating literacy experiences. The position we undertake, in favor of the considered use of TRPGs for learning through serious gaming in classrooms, is reflective of the experiences within our local gaming and learning communities. Based upon this experience and relevant literature, we contend that table-top gaming fits well within literacy pedagogy and explore how they can be used in classrooms. Therefore, our discussion is centered upon the potential of tabletop games experiences to be considered inventive, specifically in relation to the teaching and learning of literacy skills within a serious gaming framework.",

In this task, the participants have to decide which two of four rotated figures match the target figure. The dependent measures were performance speed and accuracy. In our exploratory investigation, we further examined midline frontal theta band activation, parietal alpha band activation, and parietal alpha band asymmetry in EEG as indicator for the chosen rotation strategy. Additionally, we explored the gender influence on performance and EEG activation, although a very small female sample section was given. The expected gender difference concerning performance accuracy was negated by expertise in pen and paper role-playing women, while the gender-specific difference in performance speed was preserved. Moreover, gender differences concerning electro-cortical measures revealed differences in rotation strategy, with women using top-down strategies compared to men, who were using top-down strategies and active inhibition of associative cortical areas. These strategy uses were further moderated by expertise, with higher expertise leading to more pronounced activation patters, especially during successful performance. However, due to the very limited sample size, the findings of this explorative study have to be interpreted cautiously.",

		"abstract": "With the renewed interest in tabletop roleplaying games (TRPGs) worldwide, communication scholars are offered an unprecedentedly rich site to conduct observation and research of communication phenomena. Being a game played through an extended series of performative utterances, researchers are able to observe the expression, experimentation, and exploration of identities as a negotiated process among players. Of particular interest are the expression of identities that may be marginalized and thus closeted by bearers. For TRPG players with stigmatized identities, the game serves as a back-channel function for enacting these identity performances. This study found that players used the game to experiment with, express, and explore through a confluence of validating communication to facilitate authentic or sincere play. As a result, players more fully immersed themselves in the narrative experience which was used to integrate underdeveloped facets of identity into their primary identity. These findings support the forwarding of theoretical and material contributions that communication scholars can find by studying TRPG spaces, particularly those used by people with marginalized identities.",

The results showed that game-based learning had a significant positive overall effect on students’ critical thinking (g = 0.863, k = 21) and showed significant heterogeneity among effect sizes. Among game types, role-playing games yielded the largest mean effect size (g = 1.828, k = 5). The effect size of game-based learning was larger for critical thinking disposition (g = 1.774, k = 4) than critical thinking skill (g = 0.661, k = 17). Game-based learning also had a larger effect on students in collectivistic countries (g = 1.282, k = 10) than those in individualistic countries (g = 0.432, k = 10). Furthermore, this effect size was larger in later publication years. Lastly, the effect size of game-based learning on critical thinking was larger for studies published in journal articles (g = 1.154, k = 13) than theses (g = 0.378, k = 8).",

		"abstract": "Michael Freudendhal présente son mémoire sur le jeu de rôle grandeur nature ou « larp » Legion: a Siberian Story (Rolling, 2014) qui s’inspire d’un fait historique lié à la création de la première République Tchèquoslovaque en 1918 : la marche à travers une Sibérie en pleine guerre civile par une troupe militaire de l’armée russe, majoritairement composée de Tchèques et de Slovaques.Si Legion est présenté comme une expérience physiquement exigeante avec de grands efforts pour donner une impression d’authenticité historique, il a été également conçu par l’association pour se réapproprier et transmettre une histoire nationale. Bien que l’association se présente comme développant des jeux éducatifs, Legion n’est pas présenté comme tel. Il paraît donc intéressant d’interroger la relation entre les formes de participation et la recherche d’authenticité historique de Legion.Le chercheur s'intéresse d’une part aux cadres de l’expérience, souvent mobilisés pour analyser le jeu de rôle (Fine, 1983 ; Caïra, 2007 ; Kapp, 2013 ; Stenros, 2015 ; Kamm, 2020) puisque dans ce contexte interculturel, respecter le cadre diégétique revient à respecter la culture locale. D’autre part, il fait appel au modèle MÉDIAL (Caïra, 2018) qui distingue plusieurs dimensions de l’engagement ludique. Dans le cas de Legion, l’engagement dans la Diégèse ou l’Intrigue porte à la fois sur la narration proposée dans le dispositif et à la fois sur les origines documentaires de cette narration.",

The quality improvement of the strategy adopted by the player with the proposed model, called Adaptive, is evidenced through combat simulations between a team with and without the ability to acquire information, or different levels of this ability, considering that each player can have different levels of experience. It was noticed that the ability to acquire trustworthy information can make the player’s strategy improve exponentially depending on the rate of information acquirement.",

For\nthe purposes of understanding typical modes of engagement, immersion concepts are considered alongside player motivation\ntheories. Furthermore, this article applies these categories, which are drawn largely from game studies, to the field of health care\nsimulation, categorizing specific practices within the simulation classroom according to types of immersion. The goal of this\nresearch is to enhance the understanding and design of simulation by appealing to multiple modes of immersion, which may\nassist in engaging a greater number of students. Diversifying the types of experiences within health care simulations in order to\nappeal to multiple modalities of immersion holds the potential to create more rich and layered experiential learning situations..",

The various conceptions of social, mental and cultural borders are reviewed and identified. Finally, a model is put forward where the psychological bubble of playfulness, the social contract of the magic circle and the cultural game forms are separated.",

		"abstract": "Larp is both beautiful to see and beautiful to do. Participants can appreciate the performative excellence of individual performances and other skilful exhibitions, there is a visual surface that can be enthralling regardless of the context, and certainly there is the intricate work in crafting the rule-bound bespoke design. These elements we can appreciate from afar, as an audience, whether we are also participants, or even just someone going through larp documentation, be it design documents (larp-as-designed), photographs, video, written reflections, or costumes (larp-as-remembered).\n\nThe larp as played, for the participants, has three additional ways to encounter beauty. In larp, the participants mutually play a world into being by improvising within the rules and structures given by the design, partaking in emergent co-creation through play and inter-immersion. Furthermore, participants engage in vulnerable and generous play while being mindful, embodied, and present. Yet they also remain reflexive about the conceit of larp and strive for structural and narrative excellence.",
